The Platform 2,Director is trying too hard,"To be blunt the film had me engaged and very interested for the first hour, but unfortunately it descended to a bizarre and confusing mess.

I enjoyed how the plot went in a different direction to the first and yet stayed similar, the dialogue and acting I thought was great and just overall it was interesting and left you wanting more. However, the more it went on it just became so messy and I feel as though the director was trying too hard to make the film ""thought provoking"" and quite ""artsy"".

I won't do any spoilers, but the ending especially just made zero sense. I had to google what the ending even meant and most critics also don't seem to know either, which speaks volumes. It's honestly such a mess! You can make a film thought provoking and have metaphors for life etc peppered throughout, but you have to incorporate it with a decent plot. And unfortunately this does not. It's just trying too hard at the end of the day and it falls very very flat and confusing.

In relation to the first movie, a few characters return throughout and there was definitely some scenes and dialogue that relate back to the first, which I really enjoyed.

Annoyingly I just can't get past how poor the ending really is. Nothing is answered and I feel as though I've wasted my time here. Directors and writers really need to stop trying to overdo this need to make movies in depth, thought provoking. If you're gonna do it, do it right. And this gets it wrong on so many levels (get it!)

5/10, because the first hour is really good. But the final half an hour completely ruins it!",5.0,117,17,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'director', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8907122015953064}",Negative
The Platform 2,Poor Descent,"2019's The Platform was a corker, stirring through the constant barrage of average summer actioners to become a Netflix smash for several weeks. Many stating that it was a tense dystopian sci-fi about the brutality of law and how surviving on tiny morsels of food can be the difference between life and death. It will always be remembered for its potent story, gory themes, dark tones and the strength of human willpower. When Netflix and director Galder Gaztelu Urrutia announced a follow-up many were stating if it would live up to the original, some saying that it didn't need one (some films don't). But The Platform had such an interesting concept it would be enticing to see where a sequel could go - a hopeful escape - a brutal downturn of the authority that put them people there, and would the food actually make it to the bottom?

Enter The Platform 2 - continuing that gripping story, the tense atmosphere and the brutality of human surviv...nope. No such luck here, only one of those things is on show here. The former is a brilliantly made portrayal of human survival, slowly cascading through the psyche of the human mind and kicking in the will to survive once the main source we need is gone. Descending through the walls of this monstrous pit of torture. The story's main focus is on Per√®mpuan (Milena Smit) a new resident in the pit who has one item of food that she asked for, a love of ham and croquettes. And she's bamboozled by tales of new cellmate, the food distribution and finally a merciless anarchic leader who sees himself as some kind of messiah, who's there to check if cellmates listen to the rules. Chaos ensues as an uprising of a prisoner revolution stirs through the pit walls in attempt to overthrow the leader. Unlike the brilliant original, The Platform 2 tries it's best to be as taught and gripping but fails thanks to awful story structure, and terrible direction. It's clear that within the first half hour it's apparent that this return by director Galder Gaztelu Urrutia is a grave error as it descends into a delirious sludge of colour gels.

The story touches on religious iconography with a mysterious blind cult leader who with his follows makes sure that everyone is doing as they're told. That goes about as well as it sounds, brutality ensues even going as far to go through the cannibalism and slasher film territory turning into a rehash of Cannibal Holocaust mixed with a bit of Friday the 13th (no that doesn't make sense, go with it). It doesn't help any further when there are hanfisted callbacks to the original which will make you scratch your head in confusion. The change in the plot isn't half as interesting or at all interesting as the basic premise of the plot of the original. So, it's a rehash, but then not, but also, yes. Confused? That's how you're supposed to feel. No claps of adulation here, nope, just birds spinning around your head like you've woken up from a coma.

Albeit, it's not entirely dull, as Milena Smit does her best to give a convincing performance, feeling the emotion of other cellmates and wasting away to almost nothing when the food runs out. But it doesn't expand on the original plot line or even the ideas of the original. Instead just harshly rewrites them from a different perspective. If you're hoping for some loose ends to tied off here, then you've come to the wrong place. The Platform 2 just showcases that not every film needs a sequel, much like The Descent 2 before it, it should have stayed as a solo act, just like Robbie Williams when he left Take That. 2/5.",4.0,10,12,anger,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.4824673533439636}",EMPTY
The Platform 2,I wasn't going to write a review till I saw the reviews (it's a bit long sorry not sorry),"I feel like a lot of people should just watch both movies back-to-back. That is what I did and though, yes this did leave us with more questions it does give us some answers.

This is a prequel to the first movie. I will try to answer multiple questions asked by other reviewers based on how I interpreted everything.

""What is at the bottom of the pit? To me it seems like everyone at the bottom is dead. Does that mean the girl is also dead?""

I think that the people at the bottom have been feeding off of the dozens of corpses that fall down the pit each day. They aren't dead they are just the people that gave up their freedom to save the children they found.

""Why does a child appear at the bottom and what is the purpose of sending the child up with the platform?""

Self-sacrifice. Greed was the main focus throughout the film whether it was hoarding food or hoarding power. I assume the child is placed at the last level because that is when people are most desperate. Then finally when they made it to the bottom, they were willing to step off the platform to allow the children a second chance for freedom or the child would be trapped down there with them since they can't leave regardless.

""Why does it end with the main guy from Platform 1 embracing the main girl in platform 2?""

FMC (female main character) talked about how her art caused the man she was dating to lose his child. Compare that to the first movie where the MMC (male main character) was sympathizing with the woman who was looking for her son. MMC is most likely that man the FMC was dating.

Also, the woman who was looking for her son was actually a worker who took the little boy from the pyramid so I personally and more curious as to why she joined the pit.

""What does eating the painting have to do with escaping?""

The materials used to make the painting allowed her to fake her death, through what I'm assuming is minor poisoning, so when the restart happens, they would take her with the rest of the dead bodies, and she could wake up in time and escape.

A lot of the questions are really just repeats but please also know:

1. Having and ending like this allows for another sequel to be made which I personally would like to see.

2. For the love of God not everything needs to be spoon fed to the viewer. Use some comprehension skills from school or basic media literacy to interpret things on your own and fill in the gaps with your own theories.

3. This is the fun part about movies like this. The conversation starter of morals, ethics, where to draw the line at what is acceptable and how are you to judge when put in such situations.",,2,4,fear,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.629948616027832}",EMPTY
The Platform 2,Requires rewatching the first one.,"I found this film very interesting, the performances and the atmosphere are very strong.

As most of people reviewing this film, I was totally confused on the last 20 minutes.

There's a lot of weird things going on, I've read some reviews overthinking a lot what they see and trying to give unnecessary explanations.

If there's anything clear about this film, it's that it's trying to send a message and that not everything will be scientifically explained, so forget about that.

What I've got from reading other reviews and I found interesting is how the two movies are connected.

I've seen the first one a while ago and I don't remember the event clearly, I have more a visual memory of the setting and the very skeleton of the story.

For what I've read, and I'll definitely check, the two are closely connected and it's best if the first is fresh in your memory before watching the second. Even further, someone's theory makes the movies two complementary parts of a story, so there you go.

Of course there's more questions added in this film, with a lot of metaphorical imagery to interpret, but there's a strong, solid concept here.

Technically, this film is VERY good, cinematography, sound, acting, everything looks very polished and it all works perfectly towards an intense experience.

Don't rush yourself in rate low this film, I think it's not just a simple horror, cheap jump scare, slayer, gory movie, it deserves (and requires) some thinking.

I'll come back and edit this review when I have rewatched the first part.",6.0,0,0,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.6008578538894653}",EMPTY
The Platform 2,Absolutely well done 2nd part,"If you understood the Platform movie and you liked it - the second part gave me vibe of continuation of the first part , and exploring and discovering more of this bbizzarere and super interesting concept of the platform with food going down the 333 levels.

Cudos to the creators and possible it would be even awesome to see part 3.

Gives a complete feel of the Cube movie.

Do not listen to reviews of people who dont know what they were watching or call for lots of holes in the script - this is the perk of this creation.

Its most pure to create somethign like this - which is an interesting concept and explore it deeper.

The whole movie is a metaphore. Everyone is free to interpret - but those who complain apparently may not have such ability.

Have a nice time.

The Assessment,Procreation Psychological Nightmare,"This film's premise presents a frightening possibility with a futuristic view (albeit a slight extrapolation of today's government biological interventions) within a world destroyed by climate change.

Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Olsen and Himesh Patel star in Fleur Fortune""s Debut Film (PRESENTED AT TIFF WORLD PREMIERE). Follows a couple (Olsen and Patel) who faces scrutiny by an evaluator (Alicia Vikander playing the character Virginia) over seven days to determine their fitness for childbearing in an utopian society (that has created a parallel world for itself).

The evaluator, Virginia (Alicia Vikander) represents a world where parenthood is strictly controlled, and the couple's seven-day assessment for the right to have a child unravels into a psychological nightmare. The film is commanded by Vikander, by interrogating the couple with questions and presenting stressful scenarios, displays a remarkable range of emotional and physical prowess, offering a powerful & malleable performance, from analytical government official to precocious child.

Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,Really expected more from Shahid Kapoor.,"So straight up will say this movie is bad, not the worst movie ever, but definitely wasn't very good.

Story:
The plot is quite novel, and I was interested to see how they would handle this topic of robotics and AI given that is a current hot topic. As in all science fiction movies there is an element of suspending disbelief, but this movie took it too far with outrageous and unrealistic twists and turns. I never understood the main characters motivations for wanting to take a romantic relationship with a robot this far.

Acting:
Kriti Sanon played her role well in what was a difficult character portrayal. She was the best part of the movie. Shahid Kapoor for an established well-known actor in his 40's gave a very shallow performance relying on overacting. Although he was aided by a pretty terrible script.

Songs:
Most of them were remakes, but overall, pretty fun and enjoyable numbers.

Conclusion:
If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on streaming. 3/10.",3.0,17,10,love,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8500121235847473}",Negative

Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,Kapoor's Third Act,"This is Shahid""s third act, now that he is out of the woods after a series of gritty hard grind dramas. I reckon he is on course for love on the dance floor. This flick though lacks lustre not entirely, is cheeky but effective in its dramatic liberties. The story adds a nice touch to a character based on AI which wises up to the fact that the times they are a-changing. It's about the consequences when an AI programmed bot played by Sanon provides enough of uncanny replication of human emotions and reciprocate gestures of affection which leads to unpredictable result.

Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,Mindless attempt to mix tech into family drama; typical bollywood.,"Weakest point: Script.

Weaker point: Acting; wasted some of the finest actors.

Kriti is well suited for a ROBO role as she has no expressions, her on screen appearance is good.

Shahid's role of blinded in love man is played nicely.

Rest of the actors are simply superficial. There are hard attempts to create humor but they fail to do so.

Creation team kept small things checked including maturity of how the robo gets shifted from 1 place to another in ways which will be well understood by part of Indian audience.

But, the biggest issue is with storyline. There is nothing but just a man blindly in love with robo and 2nd half is all about marriage function, typical bollywood (yawn).

Dear bollywood, Indian audience is so well versed with tech movies (while watching Hollywood), that they really can't be fooled so much. You really need to come up with something extra.

This movie looks more of an experiment rather than experience.

Ending is still mature and keeps an opening of a sequel.

Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,Relatable and relevant,"Forgive me for being an amateur but I loved the movie. I found it entertaining and to some extend, the movie played just as my imagination wished it did.

The storyline might be unorthodox to some, but is a breath of fresh air. No nudity, no insanity, no killing, just fantasy. Some like it, others don't and that's too bad for them (I guess by now, you know where I stand :)

It's easy to criticize the story of an Engineer who falls in love with a robot and laugh at it; but they are real people suffering out there who are looking for alternative to an actual human. Someone who would know you in and out, who would be ready to understand, care and show you love and if that's not enough is human like and, angel-beautiful.

Yeah-yeah, I can see the stares but our brain is complex and the connection between our heart and our brain at time hard to comprehend.

The woman enacting Sifra is for me the highlight here. My brain got so much used to her human-like robotic manners that her talking in real life is like a continuation of the movie. She could replace Siri and still be human. Spot on acting in my opinion. Let's agree to disagree.

The main actor is not left behind either. To me, he has always been the guy whose feelings are so genuinely expressed. His laugh sounds fake but his turmoil and sadness are just so real. He can be fun too and all that cocktail makes him a delight to watch.

Kalki 2898 AD,Amitabh Bachchan is the GOAT,"Finally, a sci-fi dystopian movie based on Indian mythology. Please don't butcher it... Oh, okay, you butchered it.

Amitabh Bachchan carried the whole movie single-handedly. His character is so well-written that you want him to have more screen time, unlike Prabhas's character.

Whenever I saw Prabhas, I cringed. He made around 14 heroic entries in a single action sequence-totally unnecessary. I don't understand why directors are forcing Prabhas to do comedy when there's already a comedian in the movie (another GOAT).

The Mahabharat sequences feel fresh and engaging, but they went full CGI for the young Amitabh Bachchan's face, which feels janky and breaks immersion. Someone suggested in another review that they should have cast Abhishek Bachchan as young Ashwatthama, which could have been a better choice.

Kalki 2898 AD,Good movie,"Excellent vfx, cinematography and good story. Thanks for giving such a masterpiece. BGM was nice. Visual treat. Finally kamal hassan is absolutely on fire üî• even though with this small screentime. I am rating it 7/10.

I would have given good rating above 8/10 if this movie have strong characterization of Prabhas, having fast paced stunt sequence in the first half instead of lazy slow stunt sequence.

Overall it should go for Kalki part-2.

Things I don't like :
1. Slow first half
2. Prabhas character in the first half
3. Lazy stunt sequence in the first half

Goosebumps scene :
1) First opening scene
2) Climax action portion

Kalki 2898 AD,"10/10 Story, Visuals, OST. 6/10 Protagonist, wirework","This movie comes the closest to realising a vision for a original franchise. Inspiration taken from everywhere but it's executed really well

India has nailed scenery vfx. We're as good as Hollywood when it comes to how good a scene looks

Not much to praise otherwise. It's a solid movie in it's best scenes. Proper pacing, no awkward fast forward editing.

But our problems start with movement. Wirework. The movement is hilariously cartoonish at times. You can take inspiration from Japanese/Chinese movies. They have lower budgets too but they are excellent in depicting movement. In this movie, even with super weapons. It just looks goofy when someone does a 360 roll which looks like it's from Tom & Jerry

The other main issue is protagonist. Every hindi cinema struggles with it. Bhairava (Prabhas) was literally unbearable in the first half. It's like watching this high budget immersive movie with tons of passion, then protagonist was doing 2003 South Cinema tapoori baas gunda acting. It's really awful

Background score could've been better, not very catchy and could've elevated the mood better.

Not sure why Deepika took such role when she is at such juncture of her career. The role doesn't justifies her capabilities. The movie has copied lot of concepts from hollywood.

Kalki 2898 AD,"Kalki, Overhyped Sci-Fi Disappointment","**Negative Aspects:**
The movie felt more negative than positive, and here's why:

1. **Blatant Copying:** The biggest disappointment is the blatant copying from Hollywood sci-fi classics like *Dune*, *Star Wars*, *Mad Max*, and the Marvel Universe. It's disheartening to see such lack of originality.

2. **Music Theft:** Even the music by Santhosh Narayan is heavily copied, especially the BGM for Prabhas, which sounds like it was lifted straight from *Dune*'s soundtrack.

3. **Weak Screenwriting:** The screenplay lacks coherence and purpose. Prabhas' role as a bounty hunter feels aimless and drags the movie down, making it a tedious watch.

4. **Misplaced Characters:** Brahmanandam's presence in the movie feels completely out of place and adds no value to the plot.

5. **Unconvincing Lead:** Prabhas, in the main role, fails to connect with the audience, and his character's journey to the climax is frustratingly unengaging.

6. **Misuse of Mythology:** It's easy to give anything and say it's connected to mythology, but in this movie, the attempt feels forced and unconvincing.

**Positive Aspects:**
1. **Visual Effects:** For those who aren't familiar with Hollywood movies, the graphics team did a commendable job. The visual effects are well-executed, albeit copied.

2. **NFT Artist Controversy:** An NFT artist claimed that their work was copied, which speaks to the quality of the visuals, even if it raises ethical concerns.

3. **Amitabh Bachchan's Performance:** The standout positive in the movie is Amitabh Bachchan, who delivers a stellar performance and steals the show.

In conclusion, while the graphics and Amitabh Bachchan's performance are noteworthy, the movie largely disappoints due to its lack of originality, weak storytelling, and poor use of mythology. It's a classic case of style over substance, and it's unfortunate to see such potential wasted in an overhyped package.",2.0,2,1,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8576443195343018}",Negative
Kalki 2898 AD,"A Breathtaking Dystopian Setup,Where Scifi And Mythology Blend To Give Pure Cinema...","So Finally Watched The Most Anticipated Movie Of The Year 'KALKI 2898 AD' Starring Prabhas,Deepika Padukone,Amitabh Bachan And Kamal Hassan In Main Leads,Written And Directed By Nag Ashwin. If You Ask Me To Define My Experience Of Watching Film In One Line,A Proud Moment To The Every Cineviewer,A Proud Moment To The Indian Cinema For Producing A Epic Like This Which Would Be Cherished Forever,For Trying Something Like This...
So Further Going Into Detail,Without Revealing Much The Plot Set In A Post-Apocalyptic World In The Year 2898 AD, The Film Follows A Select Group On A Mission To Save Kalki, The Unborn Child Of SUM-80, A Lab Subject. So I'd Like To Talk About The Film According To It's First Half And Second Half. Coming To The First Half, For The Majority Viewers The First Half Seems To Be Slow,Boring And A Okayish One Due To Slow Proceedings. But For Me It Was Perfect At The Core,I Mean Yes The Proceedings Are Slow Taking So Much Time To Build,But It Was Needed To Build The Curiosity And For Establishing A Setup For Which Further Payoffs Can Be Given. Yes The First Half Had It's Flaws Like Unnecessary Track With Disha Patani's Role And The Length Was Felt In The First Half. But It Kept Me Engaged Throughout The Half And Then Comes The Banger Interval Which Ends On A High Note Which You Urged For...
And Coming To The Second Half,The Real Show. Now The World Is Perfectly Setuped,Characters And There Motives Are Established. Now The Film Doesn't Give A Second To Turn Off Your Eyes From The Screen. That Engaging And Engrossing Second Half Is Proceeded. The Action SetPieces Keeps You Hooked Throughout. But What Makes This Film To Turnout Into A Epic Is It's Final 30 Min Of Climax. Words Cannot Express The Heart Pounding Experience With The Big Reveal And The Connection With Mahabharath In The Climax, It Was Just A Once In Lifetime Moment Where U Cannot Stop Yourself Clapping Over The Endcards...
While Coming To The Performances,Prabhas At His Finest. The Charm And Screen Appeal Which Was Really Missed In His Recent Ventures,""Bhairava"" Character Not Only Brings That Glory Back But Also The Climax Reveal Straight Away Keeps The Star In The Sky. Prabhas Was Born To Play ""Bhairava"". And Coming To The Amitabh Bachan,He Had Established So Finely That,If Whenever Aswathamma Will Be Discussed. Then We Can't Stop Ourselves Thinking Over Big. B. That Powerful Performance Was Delivered By Him. The Way He Handled The Action Blocks Clearly States That Age Cannot Be A Barrier To The Versatility. And Deepika Padukone,She Was Beautiful At Each Frame Of Her In The Movie,Especially There Are Few Closeup Shots Of Her Where She Acts Through Her Eyes Were Just Phenomenal. Definitely Career Defining Performance Of Deepika As A Actor.

And Then Comes The ""ULAGANAYAGAN"" Kamal Hassan,Yes The Screen Presence Of His Character Is Less. But When He Was On The Screen May Be Its Intial Half Or At The End The Performance Delivered By Him Is Jaw Dropping,Especially The Way His Character Physique Was Developed,It Just Creates A Euphoria That Yes He Is The Antagonist. There Also Some Plenty Of Cameos Throughout Out The Movie Which Were Delivered Well By Everyone...
Coming To The Technical Department,What To Say From Where To Start. The Phrase ""Visual Spectacle"" Just Cannot Define The Beauty Of The Film. That Brilliant Was The VFX And CG Work Of The Film. The Cinematography Was Just Breathtaking. The Film Visually Is Something That Never Happent In Indian Cinema,And I Even Don't Know Whether It Again Happens.

Coming To The Music,When It Was Announced That Santhosh Narayan Is Giving Music I Was So Excited Because I Really Admire His Previous Works. Some People Stated That Music Was Mid. Which I Don't Think So. For Me It Was Just Perfect. I Mean Yes Sometimes It Doesn't Feel Relevant,But When Needed He Just Created A Ramp. And I Surely Say That The Powerful Scenes Which Are Registered,He's Music Had Definitely Played A Key Role In Them. The Action Choreography Was Brilliant Keep's You At Edge Of Your Seat. Kudos To The Art And Costume Department They Were So Perfectly Placed To The World.

And Coming To The Writer And Director ""Nag Ashwin"". Hand's Down A Finest Filmmaker Had Arrived. The Previous Works Of Him Are Really Masterpieces Which Had A Heavy Emotional Impacts On Me. But From This He Clear States That The Sky Is Not A Limit For The Vision. He Won The Battle In The Stage Of Thought Processing Itself. The World Which Was Established,The Blend Of Mahabharath Which Is Rooted In Everyone Across, He Had Attempted To Bring Everything On One Stage,But He didn't Just Attempted But He Excelled In Evey Manner. A Man On A Mission Who Deserves Every Aplause...

Kalki 2898 AD,Delight,"""Majestic in scale, with breathtaking VFX and a captivating blend of sci-fi and mythology taken to new heights. A proud moment for Indian cinema, standing tall like a monumental achievement.

Director Nag Aswin guides us through three unprecedented worlds. The first half, albeit a bit slow with comedic elements, sets the stage. However, the editing could have been tighter.

The second half escalates to new 'peaks,' featuring spectacular action sequences, a compelling story, and a sharp screenplay. The pre-interval and climax moments are hair-raising, delivering ample goosebumps to the audience.

Prabhas shines in his customary coolness, delivering a solid performance. Deepika Padukone captivates with her emotive portrayal, fully embodying her character. Kamal's striking appearance and powerful dialogue delivery leave a lasting impression, adding to the film's surprises in its star-studded cast.

But it is Sir Amitabh Bachchan who eclipses all others, becoming the heart of the entire movie. His towering presence, commanding voice, compassionate demeanor, and breathtaking action scenes will resonate across generations.

The film boasts a terrific BGM and impeccable technical aspects, weaving deeper mythological connections with a robust plot in the second half, leaving the audience spellbound.

Megalopolis,"An excessive, bold, anemic and misguided mess","Reviewed by Filmmining 101:

It is very hard to describe Francis Ford Coppola's return to the big screen. His vanity project, appropriately titled ""Megalopolis"" is one of gargantuan dimensions, directed, written and fully funded by the legendary filmmaker himself. If auterism was measured in passion, you might as well classify Coppola's latest as the be-all, end-all magnum opus of an unapologetic and uncompromised vision. After spending years in production hell, ""Megalopolis"" was unleashed upon an unprepared audience.

Trying to convey the meaning behind this creation is a daunting task indeed, one that is filled with overzealous special effects of various quality, grandiose and kitsch production design, sensational costumes, heightened performances, excessive surrealistic sequences, political overtones, vendettas, love stories, unnecessary narration and title cards all inhabiting an art-deco-Romanesque New York City renamed as New Rome. It boasts intriguing ideas yet its stylistic blend leads to an incoherent cinematic pastiche.

While engaging aspects are introduced, they are as easily abandoned much to the disappointment of those who seek something more substantial from one of the most important and influential directors of all time. What begins as a dichotomy between artistic creativity with the capacity to transform suburbs if not, entire cities against a dominant and corrupted political establishment, quickly converts into a metaphor for the existing state of the US which sees the rich getting richer and the poor being transformed momentarily into useful pawns of a (very on the nose and already dated in today's climate) agenda.

Caught in the middle of utterly ridiculous and pretentious territories, Coppola's intentions are admirable; basing the New Rome as the new degenerate equivalent of the ancient capital in the US is stimulating even if somewhat excessive. He dares to argue that for a democracy to avoid falling into fascism, a bold and inspirational take for the future is required. However, this sentiment is disingenuous considering how our main character is part of the current elite society that bestows upon him a great variety of benefits. Whether Coppola is doing this intentionally or not is open for debate but this is precisely the type of politics that have been produced by people who have forgotten their original roots.

This unrestrained and occasionally pointless of 2.5 hour length extravaganza attempts to put in display heavy philosophical embellishments that could have been presented more graciously by a more contemporary filmmaker. This (at least) daring creative manifesto is more busy waving its hands about themes, yet it never offers anything substantial; it is unable to know what to present or follow amidst its myriad of superficial subplots. Its mismatched tone does not help either seeking to fulfill a somewhat inspired Greek/Shakespearean tragedy on one hand and a satire of modern day political climate on the other. Be that as it may, the absence of pathos or engaging characters prohibits from doing so.

""Megalopolis"" could be re-evaluated decades later as the work of a genius. Presently though, it cannot bypass several barriers which prevent it from having an immersive replay value. Its clunky performances erode the goodwill of its creator despite some scenery chewing performances by John Voight, an unrecognizable Shea LaBeouf and Aubrey Plaza while females existing only to gash over their lovers might raise an eyebrow for those who look out for conservative gender roles. Most importantly, six years since the ""Star Wars"" (1977-2019) saga concluded, Adam Driver is still not a thing. The actor has been playing pretty much the same genius, stoic, Italian womanizer a few movies now (""House of Gucci"" (2021), ""Ferrari"" (2024)) sharing no chemistry with the plain Nathalie Emmanuel; his Cesar Catalina showcasing a very unflattering haircut, is in hardly any memorable scenes delivering lackluster speeches to the enjoyment of no one.

Unlike his pal George Lucas, Coppola does not have the technological finesse to rely on stunning visuals and it shows. A limited number of shots can be impressive and original. Nevertheless, as the film drags on, they become more of a distraction and less of a way to propel forward the anemic plot. Lacking a time frame, ""Megalopolis"" jumps left and right becoming a Baz Lurhman and Terrence Mallick hybrid that emulates less of Coppola's own and grounded takes, distracted by a murky mishmash of digital canvases.

""Megalopolis"" is in dire need of serious editing and for each section where it might score a point, it loses three. This overstuffed narrative feature is barely standing on its own legs crumbling under the weight of a director's wishing well of themes. With moments of pure visionary focus and embarrassing execution, you can't help but admire Francis' passion to bring this story to the big screen unrestrained by studio meddling. Yet, nothing stops ""Megalopolis"" from being a meandering, tiresome and pretentious affair.",3.0,8,6,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.5654215812683105}",EMPTY

Megalopolis,The Golden Dream,"There are three things you have to do before watching ""Megalopolis"". First: leave your grumpy spirit at home (well, you should throw it in the trash, actually). Second: don't just go with the flow and the pleasure that people have when they say: ""oh, Coppola life's dream sucks"". I think people want to act in a blas√© mood just because everybody will talk about this movie for sure and they just like to pretend they are different from the mass. The mass will not like this movie at all. Third: pay attention to the beginning of the movie when you read ""Megalopolis, a fable"". Yes, dive into the movie with a fable mindset. FABLE, ok?

At this point of the year, this is the movie I liked the most. Closely followed by ""The Substance"". You know the main story about it already, don't you? Giancarlo Esposito is the mayor of New Rome, a futuristic, yet clearly recognizable, New York. Adam Driver is an architect... a scientist, I think... and he works in some public department also as some kind of chief. He discovered a new substance called megalon that defies natural laws as we know it. It is something like a living substance, in the end, something that works beneficially in a lot of different scenarios and circumstances. A panacea. He wants to build New Rome with it, to have a better and healthier and happier way of life and etc. Of course, they are in constant conflict.

That's it. No need to say more.

New York is called New Rome not by chance, but because it has similarities with Rome or, for a better description, with the way Rome has been portrayed in cinema's history.

So, Megalopolis is totally, I mean in every and each detail, grandiloquent. The performances have a forced tone of grandeur and yet they are great. Adam Driver absolutely shines. The soundtrack plays in our ears like some lost-in-time-exaggerated epic. The costumes, the art direction and the cinematography are astonishing and unreal. And yet it all feels so properly attached to our film culture, although in a twisted way. Of course this is all on purpose: Coppola took a narrative flow and transformed it into a new one of his own.

There is an implicit moral in the plot, like in every fable. It is naive and tacky, against greed and in favor of the greater good. Like the movie, itself, this plot goes through an exaggeratedly grand path.

Some may say pretentious, but this is Bram Stoker's Dracula Coppola, Apocalypse Now Coppola, The Godfather trilogy Coppola. There is no world where Coppola can be pretentious because he has his own cinema aesthetic. Cinema has a Coppola space that works in its own terms. Megalopolis is a wonderful golden show.",10.0,11,12,anger,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.5019445419311523}",EMPTY
Megalopolis,The Southland Tales of this generation,"And equally incoherent, equally pretentious, and an equal awkward mix of bathroom humor and pseudo-intellectual nonsense. But to say this movie makes no sense would be an understatement. It creates a special brand of chaos, one that seems born of a writer/director who doesn't care-and didn't even bother trying. Why Modern Rome? Why the dreadful visual effects? Why does the film have the attention span of a goldfish? No answers, and no one seems to care.

The actors, in fact, are the ones that care the least. You have massive display of talent throughout the cast, but they are absolutely clueless about what they ought to do. Some like Nathalie Emmanuel or Giancarlo Esposito go through the motions (and fail), some go over the top with no reason like Aubrey Plaza (and fail) and some just plain suck, like Adam Driver. Everything feels so weightless, so uninspired, so empty. There is a scene where Nathalie Emmanuel has to imagine the ""utopia"" by crossing through a scaled model of a city made out of plastic bottles, and it is the most intelectually cheap and creatively bankrupt scene in a big budget movie I've ever seen .

And then there's the love story, the true ""heart"" of Megalopolis. Stripped of all the noise and nonsensical plotlines, what remains is a love story. But let me tell you: this is one of the worst love stories ever portrayed in the big screen. No chemistry, no spark, no passion, no reason actually (apart from the superpower), nothing. Even the movie forgets the love story halfway through! In fact many things in the movie are forgotten, for example, you might think, for the trailers, that this movie is a mix between the Fountainhead and Caligula. But believe me, the movie forgets all those similar plot points in the third act, so what was the purpose of anything??

At times, the film even drifts into Neil Breen territory, like during the atrocious ""back to the cluuuub"" scene. To be fair, it's not always THAT bad, but still pretty terrible. You've got Marvel-like powers that don't matter, outdated political commentary that barely makes an impact until the last 20 minutes, and an ending that doesn't even resolve the film. But I think the thing that gets to me the most has to be, undoubtedly, the sense of unearned self-importance that always lurks behind this movie. The most insulting and in-your-face example would be in the first 10 minutes, when the main character starts to quote Hamlet, and it's one on the most gratuitous, pompous and hammered moments in a recent movie.

The only saving grace of this movie is an intriguing premise and a few interesting ideas, but they get lost in a sea of incomprehensible dialogue and muddled execution.

Megalopolis,Refreshing and impressive,"This is a very bright, innovative and refreshing movie by Francis Ford Coppola. While it does have its flaws, its various merits clearly overwhelm them. To begin, just making something original instead of copying the usual formulae is something to be praised by itself. Widespread negative impressions are expected as innovations in cinema are almost always blamed. Additionally, I may highlight that the movie is beautiful, with fantastic special effects (which remind Dracula a little, but with better aesthetic choices). It is Shakespearian too, as it is both tragic and ironic, with multiple characters, and a theatre-like approach. The biggest problem of the movie is that it is a mosaic, opening too many windows which eventually do not have consequences, leading to a tepid ending. Anyway, the experience of watching it was engaging. It surprises, makes laugh, shocks, excites. It moves from political irony to nonsense and surrealism, from philosophical discussion to sensual explosion, from cyberpunk sci-fi to camp. I saw various references in cinema, reminding me in different moments Terry Gilliam, Paolo Sorrentino, Alfred Hitchcock, Pedro Almod√≥var. The references to old Rome for thinking about ""a New Rome"", about a civilization which is moving into collapse, was extremely nice; not only in its visual references (including art design, situations, lettering...), but also in names and dialogues. Indeed, it is a great metaphor for current politics in the world. The struggle between tradition and innovation brlught interesting characters, but became confusing and lacked a clearer moral of the story. Of course having it open is not a problem by itself, but it seemed more confusing than consciously open to different views. What place do have the people outside those elites? Is the banker a Robin Hood? Is Megalopolis an illusion or an actual novelty? What about megalon? What about Soviet satellite? What about time and gravity control? Much more interesting was the way Clodio represented a new kind of politics that is in the core of changes wold is facing just now. Wow Platinum's role and scenes were striking and a great addition to the story. To resume, it is a very rich and multi-layered movie which I am sure the more I watch it again, the more I will notice different things, have new insights, and so forth.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,I struggled to love it,"I saw this film twice because I wanted to see it with my Ghostbusters fan friend and see if this film got better with my second viewing. I seriously wanted to love this movie. The TV spots and trailers looked awesome. This had to be the best Ghostbusters sequel yet! Nope. In fact, this might be the worst.

There's a great Ghostbusters film in this movie. There really is but studio meddling hurt the film. My first time viewing it, I walked out of the film feeling like I just got out of work. Throughout most of the film I struggled to care about anything going on and I was drained. When the actual Ghostbusters show up, I perked up a little bit. However, I should be loving this. All that stuff at the library should have been beyond exciting but not even that.

Then when I saw it again, I figured out the exact moment when I stopped caring and I struggled to get that same investment I had in the film up to this point. That scene is when Phoebe and Podcast and go into that diner for a ghost call and Phoebes ghost girlfriend is sitting at one of the tables. It was that moment and that moment on where my investment in the film cratered and I tried desperately to get back into the film.

These two characters are nothing but a vacuum that sucks the fun and investment of the film into a netherworld that you will never get back. Their scenes mainly consist of ""Hey hey sure whatever"" and I'm left shouting ""what is the point? Move forward! Stop wasting time."" And apparently, the studio told the filmmakers they had to cut 20 minutes of this movie two weeks before it premiered. Why werent these scenes cut down?

So many characters and scenes could have gotten the axe with the plethora of characters flooding this film to the point where they move the brother to Slimer duties that had no real purpose in the film. Sunny and Podcast return and add nothing. They should have eliminated them and gave the scenes from Podcast to the brother.

But theres lots to like too. Dan Ackroyd is at his best here and I'm glad Winston and Murray return too. They have a couple cool new ghosts like Pukey and Possessor that were great additions and say what you want about the new villain, but at least finally the Ghostbusters face a new villain.

And they had such a GREAT villian for this movie, like how he was the biggest threat ever. And I really did love him. But they defeat him in like 5 minutes?

How about ditching that long set-up and making room for expanding upon the ending?

One thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was the story. Similar to the 3 before it, Frozen Empire dives into folklore and creates a very interesting and intriguing backstory for the main villain. We even got to learn a little more about ghostbusting history and were introduced to a different kind of ghostbuster. The way this screenplay was written makes it a fantastic summer film.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,"Decent, but definitely not going to be a classic","I have mixed feelings about this one. They put in the effort in this one, that's for sure, however it's all over the place and messy, and it could probably use a better cut. A notable example is the intro sequence which sets the tone before every single Ghostbusters movie, but this time it simply doesn't pack enough punch. Also, there were several character and story progressions between scenes that felt weird or rushed.

The story is okay, but don't expect anything special. Once again, it feels a bit like a reboot with a lot of - often very unnecessary - fan service and well known plot points, however there's also a new angle they took that I liked. The main villain is not as creative as the ones in the old movies, and the tension leading up to the final battle is uneven. It's still quite enjoyable though, some scenes were pretty exciting and there were some great jokes as well, so it's certainly very far from being offensively bad, as some people make it out to be.

I liked most of the actors with two main exceptions. The mother character is extremely bland, I don't even remember her character's name, let alone her real name. I'm not a huge fan of Grace McKenna either, she creeps me out for some reason, but that's on me, I don't hold it against the movie. On a positive note, Kumail Nanjiani and Paul Rudd are both perfect for their roles. Dan Aykroyd seems to be having fun too, and although there's a very enjoyable scene with Bill Murray, you can just feel how much he hates Ghostbusters now.

I can't really blame Bill Murray though. I love the old movies, but they were a lightning in a bottle, and their success can never be repeated. It's impossible. Every single attempt has been inferior so far. I clearly remember how terrible the 2016 reboot was, and as for the previous one, I just don't remember anything. This one is more memorable, but probably only because of the familiar plot points and places.

Overall it's an okay movie, it kept me engaged unlike a lot of stuff coming out these days, but it's certainly not groundbreaking, and if we really want to be honest to ourselves, nobody really needed this movie.

Unfortunately this film is a wasted opportunity that feels rather drab and unorganised.

Firstly there is a big issue of too many characters being crammed in. A mix of original characters, those introduced in Afterlife, and brand new characters, all mix and combine in really uncoordinated ways. Nobody gets enough development to feel particularly engaging or fun. Mckenna Grace's Phoebe probably emerged as the lead character, but in a remarkably limp story line.

Speaking of the story, again this feels really poorly put together. Without wanting to tread into spoiler territory, I will just say that the main villain of the film has nowhere near enough screentime and the film feels like it's over just as it's getting started. For large portions of the film it feels like nothing is particularly happening and it is all leading towards something that is over far too quickly.

I think a lot of the issues with this film are because it was resting on its laurels a bit. It continually makes references to the original films to try to curry favour with fans, but these cheap attempts don't cover up the fact that the story is mediocre and the characters are all two dimensional.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,"Not good, not bad","Certainly nothing new or not seen before, but it entertains well and in its lightness it flows easily. The faces known in the past are precisely ""just faces"" without any spark or noteworthy jokes. The new characters confirm themselves devoid of genuineness and charisma, obviously light years away from the glories of the original cast. The direction as all the technical department is standard.

They tried to make the overall tone more ""comedy"" compared to Legacy, which was much more serious (too much so). But the jokes and gags are very bland and almost too derivative.

Submitted into Dan Aykroyd's shop by hokey Kumail Nanjiani, in the Rick Moranis role, is a ball which a scientist friend tells the guys contains the spirit of a vile beastie that if unleashed will turn the earth - or more worrying here, New York, to ice.

I enjoyed this a great deal more than I was expecting to. The film manages to nicely combine humour with plenty of PG rated spookery containing some imaginative special effects ideas. The problem that they have is that the film as a whole is way too convoluted with endless scenes that don't really coalesce into a whole. This is because they simply have way way too many principle characters vying for centre stage - I counted 11 / it's just excessive.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,Best time at the movies since Infinity War,"So came in with fairly low expectations. Afterlife was good, but kind of slow pacing until the nearly end. This movie however picks up at the excitement level the old one left off. The movie was exciting and fun throughout. I loved the fact that you really got to see what life was like as a Ghostbuster, I loved that the movie expanded the universe, and I loved the casting. Really liked the ensemble style approach too. I also liked it was different from all the other previous movies, particularly with some mystery elements that had us questioning what was going to happen next.

Took a single point off because the final scenes felt a little rushed and one small plot point felt a little pushed. Other than that, a fantastic addition to the Ghostbuster franchise.

Really a fantastic movie 9/10.",9.0,11,12,anger,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8761643767356873}",Positive
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,All the worse of legacy sequels in one,"After watching all the Ghostbusters movies recently and then just off of Afterlife, I had hope, or at least I wanted to have hope. But Frozen Empire turns into another disappointment.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has all the bad tropes that haunt almost every single legacy sequel. A new character who has great power but doesn't know of its existence until just now, and within minutes, they master it, check. A character who from the movie before was actually intelligent is then now making horrible decisions, check. Old beloved franchise favorites who are there for the nostalgia bait and nothing more, check. Then, of a course, a new evil villain who promises to bring about the world's destruction but is defeated almost immediately, check.

This film does absolutely nothing new and is nowhere near as endearing, as fun, or as funny as past Ghostbusters films or its far superior predecessor Ghostbusters: Afterlife.

The writing is boring, the story is dumb, the jokes are horrible, the acting is good, and the cast they do their best but with this material, there's really not much that can be done. The cinematography and cgi are good enough it's not terrible, and it's not great.

There are just so many issues with this film, subplots that are ridiculous and not necessary. Then, the culmination of this mess is just a joke. This new villain who has been built up to be a new menacing force only to be defeated within minutes of his arrival.

Finally, this film tries so hard to convince us of its grand scope, but in reality, the scale here is extremely small. Then everything ends in the Ghostbusters firehouse? This new villain seeks to destroy the world and has already unleashed a ton of new ghosts, but he just has to make a stop at the firehouse first? He's already proven the Ghostbusters couldn't touch him, so why bother with them just destroy the world as planned.

There are so many other things I could bash on, but I feel that would spoil certain aspects of the film.

Anyway, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is a very unfortunate disappointment. Especially for me as a new Ghostbusters fan. It's sad to see such a fun franchise be brought down to this.

This disappointing year continues. If Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes disappoints, then I may just die.

10 - Instant Replay: This is the kind of movie I'd gladly watch again soon. It might not be a masterpiece, but it's entertaining and holds up well, making it worth revisiting.

7 - Hold For Later: It's a solid film that I'd enjoy rewatching someday, though not right away. It's enjoyable and stands the test of time, even if it's not groundbreaking.

4 - One and Done: This could be an amazing movie, but it's best experienced just once. Its impact might come from surprises or emotional weight that don't hold up on repeat viewings, so I'm fine leaving it as that single experience.

1 - Regret Watching: This one I wish I hadn't watched. Once was too much, give me a Neuralyzer stat!

Warner Discovery better make the Twilight of the Superheroes Alan Moore's proposal in an animated film for Max.

They did what nobody asked them to do, the destruction of the multiverse, although I don't enjoy Batman The Animated Series as much anymore.

Nazis always appear in movies, comics or series when Israel's defenses kill children, mothers, civilians in Gaza.

Maybe they'll saturate the movie theaters with films like The Schindler's List, saving Private Ryan, Anne Frank, The pianist. The Spanish and English killed indigenous people and didn't make propaganda films about it.

They like to make Batman a foolish inept writhing in toxin in front of the multiverse's Batfamily.

Wonder Woman with a magnificent ass only surpassed by Dinah the young Black Canary.

Loise Lane hateful character with ugly voice of the pretty Alexandra Daddario. Supergirl is super hateful, she is supposed to be a representation of American teenagers like Zendaya's characters with pure childish tantrums to get attention.

This hateful Luthor is the same as the one written in Evil Forever by Geoff Johns.

Nightshade is a sexy and delicate pale doll with jet black hair. Doctor Light is my favorite character from the movie, she is sarcastic, moody and sexy.

John Stewart is as unpleasant as Hal Jordan or Kyle Rayner.

In the comic Crisis on The Infinite Earths the best was Superman Earth-2, with an intervention of Darkseid against Anti-Monitor.

When the Color Rings appeared it seems like they announced Blackest Night with John Stewart. Better NOT.

How did she loose her kid on this planet??

We plunge directly into the story (if you may call it a story) and hardly get any explanation of what is going on, while we see alternately each woman trying to stumble through the mist, trying to find the other and the missing kid. Oh, and there's also a ferocious entity roaming in the foul smudge, roaring its way towards the lights of the women. What it is?? Somewhere into the supposed climax of the movie we see for a split nano second the jaw of a giant predator piercing through the fog, in one bite devouring a whole astronaut, suit and gear and all. And to top the confusion: yet another person pops up, looking very much like Darth Vader, who's obviously up to no good and steals the found kid.

Maybe the makers wanted to transfer some sinister feeling of claustrophobia (in that they succeeded!), but they forgot that a movie also needs to be watchable.

Uglies,It's fine. Not Shakespeare but.... fine.,"This movie is a 5/6 star movie from netflix. Anyone giving it more is probably related to a cast member and anyone giving less probably read the books and is not happy with this version of it. And that's fine. I have not read the books and so went in without any knowledge or expectation of how it could have been. So here is my take.

They don't explore reasoning behind uglies and pretties much but it seems clear why they set up that dynamic. Society was falling apart or had fallen apart and they used being pretty as the hook to get people to do surgery that made them malleable. They just forgot to tell them the last part and while that might be effective maintaining order, it isn't really doing much for the concept of humanity. So of course, it is bad.

Breathe,Humans are doomed,"Hello Fellow Humans,

I like dooms day movies and zombie movies and alien movies and I don't mind B movies. This movie was not what I thought it would be. It had a great premise and so much potential. Humans of course are flawed and in this situation we would just die off because we can't ever work together and most humans are selfish and can't think about others beyond themselves.

But here is my issue with this movie. Why is the mother so ghetto? Her husband was a genius engineer. He was clearly able to make make enough money to build this amazing bunker. So he had to be well educated and well off. Yet his wife talks like she is from the streets. Why? Why is the daughter the mature one? Why instead of working together and trying to save humanity does this woman not care at all. It makes zero sense why this mother is making things so bad and going from zero to 9,000. Instead of talking it out they end up shooting at each other and trying to end each other. But this is typical human behavior.

Lastly so they protect this oxygen thing. Okay. Great. Then what. The mom will grow old and then the daughter is alone and will grow old. Seriously what's the point of not helping and trying. But ultimately the ghettoneas was just annoying and pointless. The mother and daughter could have talked and acted like normal humans. Was this a choice to make them talk this way or what? Either way they all just keep making things worse.

But are humans worth saving? Oh and this makes no sense. The mother refused to help people yet in the end she and her daughter needed help and they begged for it.

Code 8: Part II,"10,000 volts of more nothing","Well it didn't work. Just as I expected it.

Code 8 Part II takes off 5 years after the events of the first movie and we get the balls rolling right at the beginning with establishment of a new kind of police force, new corruption schemes and some new powerful characters in this strange new world and what we don't get, still, is the character development. I don't know why is it so hard for moviemakers of today to create a strong, alive character that you can identify yourself with, just one. None of those people on screen were even remotely close to being real.

Lazy writing and the desire to build a franchise is the scourge of today's cinema and they both are prevalent in this movie. First of all, we weren't needing the second part of the story to begin with because the first hadn't given us enough to hold on to or expect something more of - getting the second part under those conditions is supposed to having a lot changed to turn them around but sadly we were robbed of that just as well. Second and the most important is that the characters are same old, they hadn't learned anything, even the main character, Connor, played by Robbie Amell, after five years in prison hadn't changed a bit when he says one thing only to do the opposite in the exact time of ten seconds. He sure does some quick thinking when the same day he met a girl he decided to put his life at risk to save her; I'm not saying it's not noble or anything, it sure is but there's just no way he would've done that only after having said a handful of words to a person. And this whole movie is full of alike clich√©s.

Yes, it's nice to have political innuendos, corrupt policemen, two-dimensional protagonists and antagonists who can show both good and bad in them but this is simply not enough to make a good cohesive body of work if the characters themselves don't do a thing. Maybe it could have worked as a series, when you have more time to explore the universe and background of characters but as a standalone movie of 100 minutes it sure does have way too many filler scenes that don't serve the movie's purpose thoroughly.

Code 8: Part II,Not Just a Superhero Movie,"I loved the first Code 8 movie. I was thrilled to see a sequal, and the ending obviously set up for Part III.

A consistent theme with Code 8 is social justice. It highlights racism, police brutality, and economic disparity in a way that is uncomfortably familiar.

Code 8 Part II was no different in that aspect.

It was horrifying to watch the scene with the brother, Tarak, play out. You have the officers throwing a ""community policing"" event to show off their new ""non-lethal"" weapon. They're in an area that has known high rates of discrimination and brutality by police officers trying to endear that community to their ""new changes"". The way they make the K9 unit ""dance"" to seem cute and lovable is sickening. Only for it to, expectantly, kill a Power right after.

""Just put your hands up"" is a haunting phrase that POC are dismissively told in response to police brutality. I knew what was coming as soon as I heard it. I knew when Tarak put his hands up that he would be killed instead of detained.

I applaud Code 8 for its depth in social commentary. I find it enjoyable to watch and analyze its allegories to real life.

It seems many people are missing this aspect, which drives meaning into the story. Even the way Sgt Kingston turned on Garrett's crew translates into commentary on majorities using and abusing minorities, and then dropping them at their convenience.

I liked the twist that Sgt Kingston is a Power. I somewhat saw it coming, but that didn't make it unenjoyable. It is, again, commentary on how a POC might act or become ""more white"" to appeal to the majority. Passing POC or mixed POC might choose to hide in ""whiteness"" to avoid the oppressions of society. We know in this world Sgt Kingston wouldn't have what he has if they knew he was a Power from the start.

There was more world building and set up done in this movie than the last. I have a lot less questions about the world. It was interesting to see other types of powers.

One place it fell short was with Connor and the Psyke. If I am not mistaken, he has Psyke vials on his kitchen table and is implied to be a user or addict. This would explain why he survived the ending where he almost had a full overdose of Psyke. Being a user, he'd have built a tolerance.

But this implication was kept so subtle. Connor did not act like an addict, nor was this aspect of him becoming a user explored in the film. It was all very glossed over. If there was some other reason for him having the Psyke, then it was poorly shown.

Additionally, I find it odd that Connor becomes so exhausted from using his ability. He is a Class 5 - the strongest class. If he can barely send out a bolt of electricity without collapsing, what does that mean for lower classes?

I also wish the classes were a bit more obvious for the characters. We know Connor is Class 5. What about the others? I assumed Mina was a lower class Brawn since she ultimately died from gunshots and the last Brawn we saw in Code 8 basically had to be impaled. What class is Garrett? The girl?

These classes were introduced as a measure of a Power's strength and ability, but then aren't used or shown in any way.

I wish there was more depth and exploration of the characters. While I enjoyed the film, there was a lot of character development that was glossed over. If there is a Part III, I hope we are given that character exploration since the world has been solidly set up now.",10.0,3,9,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.4872366487979889}",EMPTY

The actors seemed disinterested, delivering flat and uninspired performances that lacked any of the tension or depth we've come to expect from an *Alien* movie.

The storyline, too, was a complete mess.

Ridley Scott's original *Alien* was a masterclass in suspense and atmosphere, but *Romulus* feels like a hollow shell of its predecessor. The narrative choices were baffling, introducing elements that not only felt out of place but also undermined the very essence of what made *Alien* a classic. It's as if the creators forgot what made the franchise work in the first place.

Alien: Romulus,Alien: Romulus - A Return to Form or a Missed Opportunity?,"Overview: Romulus - aimed to blend the atmosphere of Ridley Scotts original Alien, with the more action-oriented elements of James Camerons Aliens.

Strengths: Atmosphere and Tension excels in creating a tense atmosphere. The narrow corridors and dimly lit interiors of the mining ship evoke a sense of dread that calls back to the original Alien. Fans of the series will appreciate the return to slower, suspenseful pacing.

Cinematography and Visuals: The visual style of was creative. I thought the film made excellent use of shadows and lighting to build suspense, and the space scenes contributed to the overall sense of isolation.

Weaknesses: While the tension-building is effective, the middle act drags. Some scenes felt repetitive.

Character Development: The characters are undercooked (ie, underdeveloped). While the cast does a solid job with the material, they lacked depth in character development making it hard to truly care about their fates. Fans hoping for memorable new characters may be disappointed.

Story Familiarity: Long-time fans of the Alien franchise, like me, may find the story a bit too familiar. While they try to pay homage to the franchise, it often treads too closely to the plots of the original films to me, which offered little in terms of innovation.

Final Thoughts: Its a mixed bag. It delivers on the atmosphere and horror that Ive come to expect, but it struggles with development and originality. For die-hard Alien enthusiasts, such as myself, the movie offers some thrills and nods to the series' legacy making it worth watching. However, those of you looking for a fresh take on the franchise might find Romulus lacking.

Alien: Romulus,Enjoyed it for the most part,"We have a new Alien film on our hands for the first time since 2017's disappointing Covenant and Fede Alvarez's Romulus is, for the most part, a slappin' great time at the movies. Taking place in a specific chapter of time between Alien and Aliens, it chronicles a team of young Weyland-Yutani employees who feel a bit more than disillusioned with the company and decide to hijack a derelict vessel floating in orbit above their bleak, dreary mining colony planet and get the hell out of proverbial Dodge. You don't have to guess what's waiting for them onboard and pretty soon they're faced with a fight not just to escape horrible bosses, but one for their very lives. The decision to cast Cailee Spaeny here is a great one; she first caught my attention almost walking away with the otherwise underwhelming Bad Times At The El Royale and has since been on a meteoric hot streak. Her protagonist Rain is one of the best lead characters in canon, a badass, bruised warrior with a fierce emotional compass and the will to survive. There are a few things that didn't work for me; some on the nose verbal references to other films in canon were kinda lame and the choice to add the cameo of a long deceased character (and actor, I might add) using really dodgy CGI is... questionable and didn't resonate at all with me. I was hoping the film would more do it's own independent thing within the Alien-verse rather than try so hard to tie in to every little aspect and please all the disparate fans spread out over the galaxy of what has been a decidedly segmented, somewhat divisive franchise since it began all those light years ago.

He's supposed to solely protect her, until he's programmed with other orders for a while. His British accent was so annoying. The exposition is pretty decent for a while, holding us until the real action kicks in. Rain's BFF is of course pregnant POC Kay, which we learn early, and we can guess what the spawn will look like. It's an Exorcist vibe in the middle of an Alien franchise film. All we really don't know is the order in which the supporting cast dies. We know the last one standing from jump street. Aileen Wu as the bald badass Navarro was pretty interesting. The classical Remus and Romulus dichotomy is supposed to be a classy, clever detail. But it was lost on me and probably 99% of the audience. They ultimately didn't make enough of a big deal about it, despite it being in the title. Ian Holm as the corporate bad guy on a computer screen was standard issue villain. Cailee Spaeny is okay in the lead role. She's the polar opposite from Sigourney Weaver, very understated, frustrated yet determined. The guns are great, and the huge space station is a great playground for the director and his crew.

Alien: Romulus,"A love letter to the series, perfectly in between nostalgia and innovation","A director who voluntarily accepts the task of making a new installment to a classic sci-fi franchise must be both self-assured/crazy enough to think he can make a worthy addition, and brave enough to weather a storm of potentially offended fans. By setting an interquel (in-between sequel) between Alien and Aliens, Romulus has no less than two acclaimed masterpieces to contend with (and even Alien 3 is getting more praise over the years). Volunteers, anyone?

So enter Fede Alvarez, whose Evil Dead reboot already showed that a remake of a classic original doesn't have to be a poor derivative with a lack of fresh ideas, blood and gore, and who demonstrated his keen eye for squeezing maximum suspense from a tight surrounding in Don't Breathe. Together with co-writer Rodo Sayagues, he has the chops to build up Alien Romulus from the elements that made the original trilogy work, while at the same time having the imagination to come up with new stuff that make this a tense and riveting action-thriller ride that still feels like it organically belongs within this movie series, rather than a totally different franchise.

One thing that the creative team has understood well is that the real villain of the Alien series isn't necessarily the titular creature but the nefarious Weyland-Yutani company; even when hiding behind the face of synthetics... excuse me, artificial persons, their relentless greed and disregard for human lives have always been the source of all the ordeals that their employees must suffer. So we are back in Weyland-Yutani's heyday, where a group of young colonists are trying to escape their poor living conditions and the Company's tight economic clutches (no lack of contemporary metaphors here) by attempting a daring escape to a better life through an abandoned Company space station. However, as per series tradition, this Romulus/Remus station is not as empty as it seems, and as they realize what has happened, they need to run for their lives for the facehuggers and Aliens that infest the station.

The last two prequels of the series, Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien Covenant, went more into the direction of large-scope, grand philosophical ideas rather than a battle for survival on a small scale, something that was clearly not appreciated by large parts of the fanbase. Although I liked them, Romulus is a great return to the creature-feature roots of the series, with some nail-biting suspense set in very grim retro-futuristic areas full of metal and exposed wiring. In promotional material, the makers have been very proud of their largely practical approach to set design and special effects, and rightly so. This feels like a lived-in world where the scares, threats and action feel very real and the creatures deliciously icky, wonderfully supported by some CGI touches without overdepending on them. My only comment would be that the facehuggers sometimes seem a bit like sluggish robots, but that is a small price to pay for a nice old school approach that helps create such a tense and pleasantly nostalgic atmosphere.

I am even more impressed with how this movie connects with the original films, and marries their monster movie tropes to the more cerebral cautionary tales from the prequels. There are artifical persons in the movie that play key roles in the story, perfectly underlining the dangers of poorly controlled AI from the prequels; there is even a link with Prometheus that puts the Company's desire for the Xenomorphs (and thus the original films) in a somewhat new light, making Romulus a welcome connective tissue since we will probably no longer get that third prequel. Undoubtedly, those who disliked Scott's prequels will have issues with these plot elements. But that's the way it is.

Again, part of making a successful follow-up, I think, lies in a balanced combination of the old with the new. There are fresh faces from a great cast (with a breakout performance by David Jonsson), but there is one familiar face that firmly and organically cements this film within the series legacy without feeling like fan service. Neither do Alvarez and his team forget to give us the adrenaline ride that Aliens was famous for, with a few original action scenes that I had always wanted to see in an Alien movie (one with lots of facehuggers, and one in zero G), and will hopefully become iconic over the years. Alvarez can thank Ron Cobb for coming up with the Aliens' acidic blood, because I daresay that this staple of the series has rarely been used more effectively than here. All in, a spectacular white-knuckle ride that uses all the modern tools for film-making, but keep things reasonably grounded in the realism of the series.

If I have one major comment, it would be the final confrontation. Though a solid and tense climax, the makers allowed themselves to implement an outlandish idea that I found reminiscent of Alien Resurrection. Not necessarily bad (I am of the minority that likes that movie), but I found it slightly over the top and thinking that the film would have also been fine without it. But that is not a bad score in a movie where the story otherwise supports the memorable scenes quite well, rather than just functioning as scaffold for a series of highlights.

This is an Alien movie that every fan should see. As always, there will be detractors (Aliens, my favorite in the series, has them too). No doubt that some will find it too derivative still, or too alienated from the source (pun intended). I am quite confident that many fans will like how this movie walks that fine line between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Scott and James Cameron are fans, and so am I. I hope to discuss, celebrate and analyze this one in detail on line for the years to come.",9.0,4,12,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.684522271156311}",EMPTY
Alien: Romulus,8.5/10 - A love letter to Alien and the first great Alien movie in the 21 st century,"This is a well made sci-fi, like really well made. Finally we get an Alien movie from a director that understands the franchise.

The director and the team behind the scenes should be proud of their creation. I will start commenting of the visuals. Visually, this movie is absolute perfection retaining the retro 80's tech aesthetic (pure candy for fans of the first 2 Alien movies), use of practical effects (Alien costumes and robotics) and great looking CGI in scenes where it should be used: in space and on other planets and the immersion is there. I am impressed by the attention of detail and the amount of work they have made behind the scenes. I predict this movie will age decently thanks to this. Simply 10/10 in this aspect.

I should also quickly comment on the score and audio. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie using a score that was reminding of the first Alien movie. It may sound unoriginal but it was positive, I cannot put my finger on it exactly but it was like it was using the same ""canvas"" (probably using a similar orchestra). It effectively used silence in several moments as well and it was a special experience in at the cinema and the whole audience was silent in these moments. Tech and gun sounds also had the satisfying retro sound effects, nice!

Now to the actual movie: There are many good points that has been made from other reviewers but I must stress how I was impressed by how this director successfully incorporated elements from every single Alien movie making the ultimate love letter to the Alien franchise. He does not only incorporate elements from the classics (Alien and Aliens) but even sprinkles in elements from the less successful ones (Alien 3, Alien 4, Prometheus, Alien Covenant, but NOT Alien vs Predator movies) and from the latter he picks out the best parts from these movies or refines them slightly respectfully paying them homage as well. All the while preserving a well rounded, but admittedly simplistic, sci-fi horror story and we have the first *great* Alien movie in the 21 st century in my opinion.

There are some great set pieces in this film that I found clever and innovative with thrilling action and characters you root for and you will know what scenes I mean when you have seen the film.

The movie goes back to its roots in critical areas: working class characters vs corporate greed, isolated spaceship, body horror and humanity in androids. The actors overall does a fine to good job and the characters work for the story, but most of them does not have a lasting impact on the audience and I cannot remember their names (compared to iconic characters from Alien and Aliens). This is not true however for the actor playing the android who is superb in this role in par with previous android characters in the franchise (which includes amazing performances in Alien, Aliens and Alien Convenant). Why are the android characters so memorable from this franchise?

Further negative criticism of this movie lies in pacing in the final act and some over reliance on the classic instalments (Alien and Aliens). I got pretty worn out by the end because it was intense for a long time. There are some lines used that are a callback to previous instalments and it was too much ""on the nose"" or ""4th wall winking"" breaking immersion.

Other stars:
* Body horror does NOT hold back and this is GREAT but viewer discretion is strongly adviced! The body horror in Alien is central and based on the art of Giger but it is also derivative from sex, rape and fear of pregnancy.

* The intro sequence.

* The score from Prometheus was loaned in one scene, a subtle nod.

* A character from a previous Alien movie made an appearance from a deceased actor, even though the face was uncanny valley, the recreated voice was on point.

* Effective use of Chekhov's Gun.

It is probably quite clear by now that I am a huuuge fan of the Alien movies and I really enjoyed seeing this movie at the big screen. I hope future directors take inspiration from what they achieved in this movie and we can get more like this, Alien or not.

Granted there's not much to its characters but the cast provides exceptional performances that match, David Jonsson's Andy being the standout for me. A lot of my niggles come from the film's reverence for the previous outings, it stops dead at one point to ask if you still remember the events of Prometheus, repurposes iconic lines so they seemingly lose all impact; the look of Rook was ever so slightly off, combining animatronic work with CG touch-ups, it doesn't look quite right, especially given how much this film prides itself on its practical work. Benjamin Wallfisch's music is a mixed bag for me, often cropping up at the most inappropriate times but for the large majority of the runtime does the job very well. √Älvarez knows what makes the franchise work and doesn't stray too far from the familiar but builds its reputation with stunning results, Alien: Romulus finally returns us to the simple sweatiness and anxiety of the original while providing a greatest hits remix of the other entries.

Fede Alvarez the writer and director really knows how to build tension the first half is an introduction to the characters and the environment of great world building at its best.

The sets, practical effects spaceship CGI, sound and photography would be flawless apart there are a certain characters head rendered by CGI in a very distracting manor, comparable to Henry's face in the justice league.

The film is literally like a rock band playing all their number one hits to a sold out stadium playing to the crowd what they want to see and hear, hence why there is everything you would want in a alien movie here, Easter eggs and overkill on the fan service.

alien tick aliens tick, acid blood tick tick etc.

The xenomorphs kill a bunch of people, but usually leave a one or two alive to aid their escape from the impending doom of the moment. And so it is with Alien: Romulus.

Alien: Romulus,A Brainrott Alien film,"I'm truly baffled by this. I've been a huge Alien franchise fan since I was eight or nine years old and have seen all the movies multiple times.

What's confusing me is how Romulus got a pass by ""Fans"" and is being praised highly while the prequels were slammed.

First off, I liked this movie, but it's flawed. I can see where the director and writers were trying to appease to the minority in the fanbase who suffer from cultural brainrott. They took elements from the original film as well as the prequel films and tried to weave the two together. The attempt was nice, but the result was nothing but a Memberberry film where one liners from past Alien films were used and pointing out things for fans to notice much like jangling keys to distract a toddler.

What made most the elements of the story sinful was the complete disregard to the lore of the franchise and OG film and even appeared to have lost its own plot halfway through the movie, almost giving the feel that the script was written by Chat GBT.

The good thing about the film was the visuals, the two main leads, Andy is probably my favorite character in the film.

Alien: Romulus,One Easter Egg kills the whole thing.,"Look, I love a good Easter Egg when it comes to the nostalgia factor, but there's one Egg (and if you've seen the movie you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about), that for me, turned what was a great movie up until that moment, into a parody of itself.

I'm a Gen X and was born the same year as the original, and then watched the classic James Cameron sequel as a kid on the couch with my Dad. So I was super excited to take him to the movies to see this on the day it was released (my Birthday!). All the stars aligned for a nod to a nostalgic favourite.

I was initially sceptical of the young cast going into this, but to their credit, they blew it out of the water with great performances... until this one Egg. And then, it became very obvious that this a movie being made for a millennial audience. If I'm brutally honest, there were probably far too many very obvious Easter Eggs from every single movie in the Alien franchise stringing this entire film together, but it was this one thing that should NEVER have been included. I had to stop myself from screaming out ""Noooo!!"" as the words were being said.

Aside from that, it was a great finale to end this franchise, with this ""bonus story"" (think Star Wars' Rogue One), set in between the first and second movie, really circling back to the dark and claustrophobic cinematography of the original which creates the right atmosphere for this story. The sound and visuals are bang on point and overall, a solid 7.

But without Sigourney - but trying to recreate a revered and scared Sigourney moment... Just one Egg too many.",6.0,1,9,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'visual', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.5298706889152527}",EMPTY

Alien: Romulus,A tough choice,"When you're going to be a filler between two movies (being classics), what are you going to do? Are you going to praise them, going high on them, probably trying to expand the boundaries you are going to be caged within?

It does exactly that. But, with Prometheus (and the other thing that followed) already being in existence, it tries to blur that it is an inbetween of 1979 and 1986. If I was director, I would not have tried. The probability of failure is high.

Yet - it manages to get along. It does not fail. And if you like Isolation, you'll even get something back from what never was a movie, but a video game that brought 1979 back to life in all its glory.

But then, seeing Kane in CGI-flavor is not cool though. Not like this. Explaining what doesn't need to be explained is neither. Director and writer have courage, yes, but in the those few decisive scenes they hesitate.

Actors made it worthwhile, that is to be said. They bring on what is to be brought on. Casting did a job.

In the end, it's a good pop, a nice trip - what was possible within the boundaries was made possible. What kind of vision can you produce when you're a filler, yea?

Alien: Romulus,Mixed bag. But it's basically an amalgamation of the original four Alien movies...and not really in a good way,"I think it continues the negative trend in movies that basically everything worth seeing is in the trailer and when in doubt throw in a classic line as a low effort, unearned ""callback"" that gets the obligatory whoops or laughs.

One of the other trends it is continuing is how its greatest strength is the visuals, and greatest weakness is the plot. Here's the thing that I realized while watching. The original Alien wasn't beloved for its resounding story. The plot itself is fairly straightforward - a bunch of space truckers try not to get killed by wildlife that snuck aboard their transportation. The characters were more of a Greek chorus than fleshed out individuals, but they were unique enough to be distinguishable. I think both of these things actually served in its favor, especially relative to Romulus.

Dude, I do not freaking care about the pilot that is the very first one to die. I don't really care about the guy whose mom was left to be abandoned in the mines by a synthetic (especially if you don't any more than to give him solely that for characterization). Quite honestly, in this movie, the main character is likable, but that's the problem, she's just a very very blank slate. She doesn't really screw up but by the same token she doesn't really DO anything either. She kinda just goes along for the ride and yeah she'll shoot up a bunch of xenos...but I would guess anyone with a modicum of self-preservation and an aim assist weapon would do the same (more on that later).

We learn a lot of facts about main character, Rain. We learn about how her parents are dead and she dreams of seeing the sun because the mining colony never sees the sun. Clearly the aim is to get us to empathize with her. None of it is bad, it's just not stirring and it's definitely not what they're trying to evoke unless you're basically enamored by the concept of people longing for more. Like I said, she's a blank slate. Of probably at least 70% of movies to release in the last decade, she's just as copy-paste.

Contrast this with Ellen Ripley in her debut. We had no idea who she was. We didn't know anything about her. In fact she wasn't even really one of the more prominent characters in the first half, she kind of naturally became more proactive as the crew grew smaller and smaller. But like I said earlier, while the characters were still distinct, they were mostly mysterious to the audience outside of the limited context of time the movie takes place in narratively, and funnily enough I think that makes us empathize with them much easier. ""Show, don't tell"" as they say. We saw a crew working a grimy, assumingly poorly paying job for a big corporation, but they joked and bonded and argued and were human. We didn't have to know who was related to who or what their childhood baggage was. I think this made it easier for the audience to project themselves into this group. But the movie wasn't concerned about defining the relationships between the crew anyway, because it wasn't really about the crew, it was about the alien.

Again with the troubling trends, it's an issue shared by the five nights at Freddy's movie, Halloween ends, Batman vs Superman, the list goes on and on. We come for the animatronics. We come for michael Myers. We come for the Alien. We don't come for the 5% of the movie that is things and the rest of the runtime bloated with overly dramatic music and poorly constructed plot. What I'm trying to say is these movies forget what they're ABOUT. Surely, a movie solely of quick cuts between alien kills would be messy and nonsensical. But just as nonsensically, you come into this movie learning a lot about a knock off Ripley which only serves to remind you of why you liked that movie in the first place, because the alien was an ever present threat. This movie is definitely NOT about the alien. Five nights at Freddy's is NOT about the animatronics. Halloween Ends is NOT about Michael Myers. All of those movies were about random human characters really devoid of anything interesting about them whose stories we have to be coerced into caring about. That's fine, but just make it a different movie, don't hijack an established IP for your character study vanity project.

Again, Alien worked and highlighted the bond between the crew almost because it tried not to, because it was about the alien and not the crew. In this movie, admittedly there are some awesome visuals with the Alien(s). There are a bunch of frames that could basically be comic book covers or movie posters themselves. The movie is pretty pleasing to watch. But the aliens themselves are incredibly weak and frankly stupid. For being ""perfect organisms"" as the script writers loved to hijack instead of writing their own thing, they really like to charge headfirst into a wall of apparently lethal gunfire. One scene that stands out in particular is when one of the characters is separated from the others by a door, and the alien is clearly seen behind her and slowly approaching. The entire tension is supposed to be about how the door won't open. But it's a foregone conclusion. You've seen this scene play out a million times in even the tamest scary movies. And the resolution of it is so fast and obscured as it is predictable you wonder what the point of wasting runtime for THAT even was.

In a funny way, this movie is just a xerox of the first four alien movies. It doesn't nearly have the value of the first two, but it definitely wants to trick you into thinking so with how many callbacks and homages it shoves in your face since they couldn't think of anything new. What's the point of a callback if it doesn't even make sense? At one point, you have the synthetic ""brother"" figure shoot an alien to protect Rain, where he brokenly says the classic ""get away from her, you bitch"". You could argue he's supposed to be familial with her in a way that Ripley and Newt were as well. But the two lines outright are really incomparable. Ripley became a mother figure for Newt, and this was the introduction of the concept of an alien queen, so it was very satisfying to see Ripley's momma bear side come out and the line was earned and delivered perfectly. Here, Rain had literally been mowing down chunks of xenomorphs by herself five minutes before, and while she probably would've died without his help, she had been honestly more of the caretaker for both of them throughout the film if anything. So maybe you could chalk it up to some kind of inversion if you want, but the fact is it lacks the same punch and gravitas frankly because it comes out of nowhere and blatantly says ""remember when you liked hearing this line the first time?""

So, ripping off cameos (forgot to mention both the ORIGINAL alien and Ash's actor as a different yet still evil synthetic appear) and Aliens's penchant for 80s action violence, the first two movies are covered. There were bits of the third movie in there but that's not really the important part. They decide to redo the Newborn from Resurrection, and they honestly might have made it a bit worse. Spoiler: the black goo comes back, and apparently it ""is life itself"" in this film. The ultimate use for this Chekov's gun? Ummm...the big bad final fight is between a nightmare of an abomination that is the newborn, the engineer, a human, and a xenomorph all in one. Born from a human female, again. It even dies basically the exact same way the first one did. (Although, props again, that really did lead to one of the coolest shots in the movie. But visuals go so far and you definitely get the feeling they were so proud of the shot they felt it would make up for the other ways the movie dragged.) It was actually so jarring it was funny. I honest to God heard some confused laughs when it was revealed because it did look very creepy, but in a really awkward way. The movie definitely also feels like all four movies in a more literal way - this entire fight literally comes out of nowhere as a manufactured conflict right at the end when you're begging for it to just finish up already. In fact, there are probably 3-4 times in the last half hour they fake you out with an almost-climax just to throw in some random arbitrary new problem that is just as easily solved. It really breaks the flow and makes the movie feel more bloated, especially because it tried to be a character study but forgot about half of the dynamics and themes it wasted runtime trying to set up instead of, y'know, making the villains feel threatening and imposing and ominously omnipresent.

This review has already gone way longer than I envisioned and I feel like there's still so much to say. It's just a mixed bag. It is absolutely a popcorn flick you can have fun with. But the twitterheads will treat it like the second coming of the Alien franchise for...some reason. The marketing I guess. Frankly, it's pretty discouraging that that just seems to be par for the course and the new bar to clear for the modern moviegoing audience, just turn off your brain and pretend you're finding a deeper message and then go on Twitter and arbitrarily praise the top billed actor or the director or the cinematographer or something. Again, the trailer definitely showed you everything it needed to. I remember people freaking out about how they used the song Ripley sang in the first one and apparently that was the standard that decided if this would be an amazing movie or not. That, and Fede Alvarez, who is imaginative but kind of in the way that feels like ""wouldn't it be so messed up if someone died like this"" and then writes that in instead of, again, remembering what the movie is about and letting things feel more natural. The trailer was literally telling you all it had to offer was good visuals and nostalgia bait. So the people who put all their eggs in those baskets will probably love it and far be it from me to take that from them. It could've been as good as the first, it just didn't want to try.",6.0,0,0,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'visual', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,negative,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7298992276191711}",EMPTY
Alien: Romulus,Moments of Brilliance but not the whole time,"*spoiler free*
First off I have to say, if you have never watched an Alien movie most of this movie will be great for a sci-fi horror movie. Now as a fan boy of the series since I watched my first Alien movie in 1987 and I have to say it was a joy to watch. Does it destroy or walk over the other movies in the series? No, but there was one line that wasn't needed in the movie. Visuals were like a flash from the past and done brilliantly. Story was a solid 8/10 with a few small gaps that I didn't like or could have been explained better but I assume that when and if they make a special edition like they have with almost every other Alien movie they will fill in those gaps.

I truly think that this was a great movie in the series, it hit on almost every front. I wish that they had stolen or copied the video game Alien isolation's story vs this one but.... I enjoyed the movie, they only dropped the ball in the last 5min of the movie.

Alien: Romulus,A homage to the original,"We are taking it back to the original trilogy with this one. Well the first and second movies at least, we don't talk about 3rd here.

You can tell that Fede Alvarez was either a huge fan of the original movies or just really did his homework because of the amount of homage and references this movie has from the original films. Also I don't know but it felt like the film is heavily inspired by the Alien: Isolation game or Dead Space because the vibes as well as the hybrid alien at the end is very similar to the Necromorphs from Dead Space, at least in terms of design.

It's also nice to see Rook back even if he's still a little messy, they did good with the CGI maintaining how he looked during the first Alien movie. Also with wayward teens/young adults as the main cast I found it more believable that they would make constant human errors and mistakes, unlike the previous movies who are adult professionals and still make the most not so smart decisions.

Like the first films the gore in the movie is also very minimal, there isn't really that much body horror aside from the more modern chest explosion scene.

With all that said it's not a perfect film, there are still questionable parts and even lore plot holes but it's not really a major problem for the movie overall.

I wonder if they make the next Aliens movie if they plan on offing the survivor here again which they seem to do. I know Ripley can never be replaced as the ultimate final girl in the Alien franchise but it's just bothersome how we go through this journey with a main lead, survive the everything, only for that survivor to just be unalived in the next movie.",8.0,2,8,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7189323902130127}",EMPTY

The ending with the ""Offspring"" could have been a disaster but it was a crazy twist and addition to the lore. Absolutely terrifying creature. It also accomplished what Alien 4 couldnt by introducing a genuinely scary and memorable xeno/human (and engineer) hybrid.

Alien: Romulus,"For fans of Alien, Aliens and Alien Isolation","I really enjoyed this; the visuals are nearly all absolutely exceptional, with strong references to Alien, Aliens and Alien Isolation throughout, that latter one being my favourite video game of all time (I still play it).

Yes, there's a lot of fan service and Easter eggs, and I thoroughly enjoyed nearly all of that.

The only part of the movie that made me cringe was a reference to Prometheus which, along with Covenant, represent the lowest point in the franchise in my opinion. And then it goes a bit Alien Resurrection... but fortunately nowhere near as goofy... more like the video game Dead Space, so I was able to forgive it.

Otherwise, I think the story is quite original, and takes a few unexpected turns. I found it tense, with some great action set pieces. The acting was solid, and particularly outstanding were the characters of Rain (who reminded me of Amanda Ripley in Alien Isolation) and Andy.

There's also a surprise cameo, which... well, I don't know what to make of. You could criticise the visuals or you could believe they were deliberately a bit uncanny. I found it off-putting, but not to the extent it spoiled the movie.

As a fan of the first two movies and the aforementioned video game, this gave me more of what I wanted, and very little of what I didn't.

Alien: Romulus,So promising but left a little too many good threads on the table,"Abundant spoilers and only a review for those who have already watched.

This film starts out masterfully, further immersing the viewer in this world and building out some imaginative lore. The initial call to action for our newest doomed crew is clean and clear, characterizations strong enough, and atmosphere and build up appropriately utilized. I was laughing in pure excitement and grinning at the sheer fun and fan service of it all up until roughly halfway through. One particular sequence reintroducing us to the face huggers had me genuinely giddy. However, once our first chest burster explodes gloriously forth, I found myself slowly growing disappointed as the interesting set up only gave way to the same recycled story. In addition, the writing became worse as the film continued. Rain begins to distrust Andy, which we can see by the look on her face yet she asks out loud ""Andy, are you in there?"" Or something to that effect. We aren't dumb. We know that's what she's thinking. A screen tells us she has to pull one last lever in a pivotal fight - yeah - we gathered that when she was smacked away from the lever before doing so. She looks at Andy once he's safe and tells him ""im going to fix you"" - again - we can already tell!

As we start to revisit familiar beat after familiar beat, predictable character deaths and are over exposed to the xenomorph, my mind began to wander to the many plot holes, missed opportunities and unfulfilled character arcs.

The initial colony and world through which we first meet our characters, though intriguing, began to not make sense. How did these people end up on this colony? Were they born here? Are they essentially indentured servants? Are they criminals and this is punishment (hence the arbitrary addition to their servitude)? If they aren't there as punishment did they volunteer? Did rain's parents volunteer? In any case, why would that possibly have a child in such dire circumstances and birth her into a life of misery? How do these colony slaves even know about this other (apparently) nice planet? How did they gain access to a ship with which to travel to the Romulus space station to begin with? Is that just theirs? If it's not theirs and they are essentially slaves, wouldn't someone from the Weilan Corp/some sort of police force come after them for commandeering an unauthorized ship? If the Romulus space station is some high tech, military grade research station, how did the xenomorph escape and kill all the previous researchers whilst also allowing them time to manufacture dozens of face huggers? How did they manufacture a face hugger for that matter? By somehow using the incapacitated xenomorph? Aren't they separate organisms? How would they even know what a face hugger even is, let alone think to engineer them, if they haven't seen one? Why did Rook say there was only one alien and they had killed it, inadvertently destroying the ship when there were apparently dozens? If what indeed did transpire was the killing of the xenomorph and the destruction of the ship's integrity, how did the ship repair itself well enough for them to board it? How did the morally dubious inclusion of Ian Holm get green-lit for that matter? Does anyone else find that creepy?

As these questions begin to percolate in me I began to envision a more satisfying middle and end after an invigorating opening. Why not have them encounter the already existing aliens on the station, fight for their lives, escape to their cryo pods and then SPLAT our chest buster, having laid dormant until now, finally bursts forth, escaping the pod, thrusting us into one last fight? Or maybe have the alien emerge, wreak havoc, and just then colonial forces arrive, tell them they're adding indefinite sentences for all of them for illegally piloting a weiland ship. Maybe they say they're bringing them back to the colony, our heroes protest ""there's a creature!!"" But of course they're not believed, BOOM / the creature is brought to the colony and then the action starts. A Weiland colony destroyed by the very thing they created. Why establish one character's hatred of androids without perhaps an arc of him risking his life to save said android so he can continue to help the mission? Why not have rain's boyfriend fight Andy to remove the corrupted chip/new directive in order to bring him back to his senses and help save rain, perhaps dying in the process? Maybe he even reminds him with a refrain ""you're a good guy, Andy"". Why not have Andy stand between Rain and a xenomorph, fulfilling his primary directive and sacrificing himself for her? That might have stirred a tear. Why in the world would Andy say ""stay away from her you bitch?"" It makes even less sense considering why it worked in aliens as Ripley knows she's speaking to the queen that produces the xenomorph. Maybe just when they think their safe, reveal one last alien onboard and crash us into the colony we see destroyed in Aliens? I just feel with a rewrite and more imagination there were numerous other routes to explore that would have proved more fulfilling.

It felt that we were given all the correct elements yet none of them were fully realized. All culminating in what for me was a truly boneheaded curveball in the last ten minutes. The whole mission to create the perfect being and it comes out like that? Yeah, try turning those things into an obedient work force, let's see how that works out for ya.

Alien: Romulus,Toasty!,"To say that ""Alien: Romulus"" is a clich√©, is a clich√© in itself. Director/writer Fede Alvarez (the guy who made the popular ""Don't Breathe"" back in 2016--I have nothing else on him) and his cast of relatively unknown actors are not threading any new grounds--literally, as the plot takes place on the same spaceship as the original 1979 movie and serves as a sequel to it. However, even if the movie has modest ambitions, it does its job well. This is a traditional Hollywood horror movie: it has its jump-scares, disturbing and stomach-churning moments, and the cast is methodically and creatively picked off one by one in gore-tastic fashion.

With its trademark xenomorph-inspired creatures let loose to cause dreadful havoc across its two hours runtime, this movie is also just good enough to feel like it deserves the ""Alien"" badge in its title as fundamentally, the ""Alien"" movies are about creepy things jumping at you from the dark. The reason why the original ""Alien"" was such a referential horror movie is because of its Hithcock-ian principles of keeping the monster hidden as much as possible--I will never forget the dark, cold, endless mechanical crevasses in the ship's walls, all places where the xenomorph would constantly sweep in and out of view. ""Romulus"" has nowhere near as much patience. The aliens appear, destroy, make themselves unseen and repeat. Each iteration however is more and more interesting and horrifying, and there is a particular gravity-bending scene which I liked.

But what is the point of ""Alien: Romulus"" anyway? First of all, the title refers to one half of the derelict spaceship's quarters, and of course it's also a reference to the legend of the Roman Empire's founders, Remus and Romulus, who were supposedly raised by a wolf. But the reference doesn't make much sense in the context of the movie. Artistically though, its purpose is an excuse for Alvarez to showcase his textbook horror skills which while executed perfectly, have a college boy feel to them. And business-wise, it's a way for the up-and-coming cast composed of Cailee Spaeny (who had a lead role in the critically acclaimed ""Civil War"") and David Jonsson (who gives a breakthrough performance as a conflicted android) in the lead roles among others to impress the Hollywood brass--and horror is a great genre for that.

Rook.

Alien: Romulus,I felt sorry for the alien.,"As a kid, growing up in the 80's, I always heard about these two films about an alien that attaches itself to some pour soul's face and impregnates them with an alien that then bursts out of their chests. I was both fascinated and horrified by such an idea but, eventually, my parents recorded the first Alien film for me and let me watch it and I was on the edge of my seat for two hours. Same thing happened when the sequel, Aliens, premiered on TV. I can still remember us all at school on the following Monday raving about it.

Since then I've eagerly awaited every new Alien film but unfortunately none of them have managed to match the same magic as those two films. That's not to say they were all bad, I actually get some enjoyment out of the much derided Prometheus.

Unfortunately I can't say the same about the new film Alien Romulas. I hate to be that guy but I just don't get the hype.

A bunch of foul mouthed youngsters wish to escape a mining planet by taking some sleeping pods from a space station in the planets orbit. Unfortunately, you've guessed it, it's inhabited by Aliens and a much repeated formula ensues.

The first glaring problem with this rubbish is the fact that absolutely nobody can act. In the original film we had acting royalty like John Hurt, who despite less screen time than the rest of the cast is still remembered by everyone, and Yaphett Koto and obviously the legendary Sigourney Weaver. Honestly you couldn't get a bigger come down from such legends. I absolutely hated every person in this new film. They were all awful and unlikeable.

There's also no suspense in this film at all. I can watch the original and still be on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I've seen it, same goes for Aliens. I didn't care about anyone in this film and just wanted them all to die so it could end.

There's a few nice ideas that try to bring at least a little something new but the execution is diabolical.

A massive let down and when quotes, from the far superior originals, were used I actually groaned out loud regardless of anyone else in the cinema hearing me.

My girlfriend is a die hard Aliens fan who still has her special edition VHS tapes and proudly walked into the cinema with her Aliens t-shirt she got with an Alien 3 boxset she bought 30 years ago and even she admitted this was bad!

Alien: Romulus,Infantile,"I can only laugh... are these scripts written by pre-schoolers?

The aliens are clumsy, not more threatening than some wild bears. Not even scary. The teenage crew is similar and their acting - the absence of it -, is scary instead. You can tell all of them are cannon fodder, since none of them have any character.

Physics is non-existent (you know a room cools down if you open a big garage door on one end), events happen random as the situation demands, some doors cannot be opened, but you can always turn gravity on and off for the whole station at every corridor. And you know you can just knock off facehuggers (bring a sword next time, problem solved; the aliens would have failed great time in medieval Japan). Androids can easily fall down multiple stories with no problem.

Oh, and aliens grow faster than bamboo in the monsoon in this movie too. A chestbuster or a full grown adult grows in ten minutes or less (from what matter? Thin air?). That ridicuolus abomination at the end basically grows _instantly_ (""nanotech, you know"" would it say if it was in some Avengers movie). Do these guys know that they can actually write a script easily where time jumps some hours in a few minutes screentime? There are some techniques for that, they should check the first three Aliens movies. Those are all the Aliens movies we have... the rest are just ""tries"".

Four stars, because it's bareable once, dialogs are not utterly annoying, there is _one_ shooting scene - I must admit that was clever to a degree, gravity or not, the climax for me, downhill from there -, and it's still better than Prometheus or Covenant.

Alien: Romulus,Alien: Blumhouse,"I saw this thing just tonight, my expectations were high. Nonetheless, I found myself cringing through the pointless callbacks to the fan favourites, laughing through the action sequences, predicting every single plot point, and mouthing ""Why?"" every time our main characters made a horror movie decision. It seems IQs just dropped sharply while we were away. Alien (1979) is a masterclass in suspense, horror, and world building - a simple enough premise, a slasher film set in space, executed damn near flawlessly. James Cameron's Aliens was more than a worthy sequel, which built upon the foundations laid by Ridley Scott in an excellent way that carried through all of the first movie's themes wonderfully, and added it's own unique spin on the plight of Ellen Ripley, with themes of motherhood and feminism. Alien 3 exists, and to me, is the end of the franchise. Alien Romulus takes the legacy of this trilogy, grinds it up into a fine paste, and squeezes it out in blobs of cheap fan service, cheap scares (bar one), and almost nothing of substance.

Did I have a good time watching this movie? Yes, but for all the wrong reasons. Gone is the silent tension of the first movie, and the high stakes action of Aliens, and in is an uninspired compilation of action eye candy. Rewatching Alien, I still feel the same sense of dread seeing the crew of the Nostromo enter the crashed spacecraft, when Ash approaches that egg, and in the moments leading up to the titular Alien's birth. In this movie, you've seen it all, and what was once a terrifying roller coaster of incomprehensible horror and chaos becomes a shoddily executed re-tread of the same old tropes.

Alien: Romulus,Neither Everything nor Nothing,"In the twenty-second century, space exploration does have limits, but is common. On one of the colonized planets, a group of young low level workers is desperate to leave in hopes of finding a better life among the stars. When an abandoned ship is detected orbiting the planet, they see it as an opportunity to obtain some resources vital for long distance travel, and they decide to risk it.

This is a monster movie set aboard a spaceship in the future. Other than the environment and the creatures, unfortunately, nothing is good about the movie, it is chaotic and hysteric, it does not take the time to work with the components it uses, it simply smashes the audience into everything, and nothing works.

If you saw ""Evil Dead"" from 2013 and didn't like it, I won't blame you, but when it comes to working with the characters and the story to tell, Fede Alvarez did give that movie a structure, it had a prologue, then it set things up and explored things, and then it went berserker mode. This time, with ""Alien: Romulus"" here, Alvarez also has a prologue, but then there is a problem. There is a lot of material here, and the movie simply tries to plough through it to reach an ending, and that ending is abrupt.

This movie is a part of a big and popular film series. The way it ties into the whole series does not make sense. To ""Alien"" from 1979, ""Alien: Romulus"" from 2024 is what ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" from 2019 was to ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" from 1983. The plot that it has is made of things borrowed from the other movies in the series. And if you think it only steals from the best, then how about a disgusting pregnancy related scene? Was it inspired by ""AVPR"" from 2007?

""Alien: Romulus"" is a pile of things taken from the other ""Alien"" movies whether they belong in one story or not, and it confuses ""scary"" with ""repulsive"".

The movie was a boring mess.

To start I'd have to say that don't expect anything to happen during the first 75 minutes. Yes I watched the time in the cinema because I was like , is an actual alien showing up anytime soon ? Nope more than half of the movies is just teens goofing around.

So the movie starts in a working colony in a galaxy far far away. There workers...work for food and shelter and after like 12k hours of labor are allowed to live the planet for another one. Of course the 12k hours contract means nothing because it's shown that the government changed that in the blink of an eye without much explanation. So the protagonist unable to work for another 12k hours decides to embark upon a journey to freedom.

We are introduced to her other slave friends that somehow have access to top end computers , can scan the galaxy and are tech savvys. These guy have found an abandoned ship , which none from the government has , and they have another small ship to fly there.

So these guys have money for a ship and they just leave the planet to go to space and take recourses from the abandoned ship. No one ever tried stoping them nor anyone was alerted during the entire movie....

So they fly there , they park and everything of course works and has fuels and batteries charged. They conveniently have an android with access everywhere so they good to go. Damaged ship and dismembered bodies don't seem to bother the group at all so they keep going their mission.

At some point the aliens awake. More than half the team is gone in the first encounter living us with basically 2 people and a robot for the rest of the movie.

Btw you remember how much the alien needed to stay on someone's face before it implanted an egg ? Lots of time right ? Here it happens in like 15 minutes. One girl gets the face hugger , after 15 minutes they remove it but it has already put an alien in her. After an hour or two she was eliminated and the alien was born. After half an hour the alien was a full grown Xenomorph...

they could make it there, they could use Andy to converse with the stations system and they could use it to get to Yvaga.

Does that mean it's bad - no, but it is not good either. It's a lesson in film making of trying to mix the first and the second films to appease fans and see if you get something good out of it instead of being original. What you end up with is the frustrating and unsatisfying feeling what could have been. Plus points - cast is good, decent acting, set design excellent, non-CGI effects (see negatives), very good. Downsides, let's start with the worst- CGI character. Absolutely terrible, completely ruins suspension of belief and destroys film. If it has been a 5 min cameo, might have just let it go but when it becomes a main character, it just ruins everything. WHAT were they thinking? Well, I think I know which leads us to the second major problem - fan service. Trust me I could not be more of a fan of Alien but the amount of Easter eggs is farcical. Again, if in the background and the odd one, maybe, but when they are forced down your throat (no pun intended) it again just repeatedly breaks the suspension of belief. It's annoying and so unnecessary and the worst has to be the repeated dialogue. This adds what exactly? Please, just stop. Third downside and this is related to points 1 and 2 : no suspense. In the first 15 mins aboard the ship I had high hopes but soon after it was soulless. You could predict every single jump scare and every plot point. Utterly predictable. If you rewatch Alien, it is masterclass in film making and suspense. Claustrophobic, totally immersive and SLOW to build the tension to unbearable levels. Remember the Alien itself was slow and deliberate - a brilliant idea. At one point in Romulus, I looked at my watch to see how much longer there was.

The action sequences are pretty good, and as usual the Xenomorphs are badass and calculated with their tactics and approach but when you are a fan of something like Alien and Ripley for the perspective of a brilliantly intelligent and badass female character you tend to want to see that continued in a franchise. Unfortunately, none of the human characters in this movie were even remotely likeable to me. They all held deeply regrettable flaws and were selfish, egotistical and ignorant which made them really hard to root for - and that includes the final girl Rain Carridine.

The saving grace is Andy, who happens to be an AI which may be a bit of a spoiler but nevertheless the perspectives his character brings and the moral dilemmas he makes you think upon in consideration to the human characters is crucial to the storyline.

One aspect of things is a bit predictable, but I will keep that vague on purpose and say that hybridism is a strong theme here for sure.

All in all, a mixed bag because it was well-written, well-filmed, and had some good actors who I really like such as Archie Renaux but the final girl lacked substance, was too weak, and was manipulative and borderline foul as a person.",5.0,1,4,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.4850320518016815}",EMPTY
Alien: Romulus,A better knockoff than most.,"Gorgeous in cinematography, Alien Romulus replicates its predecessors to the point of bastardizing quotes and legacy moments from prior Alien installments. The premise here is an identical facsimile of past Alien movies, just without the character development, industry setting pace, or other vital details which defined the original as groundbreaking or the sequel as thrilling. Fede √Ålvarez plays it very safe here, a directive he most probably received from the film's producers and corporate executives (who spinelessly refuse to greenlight anything original for fear of failure, only for their pathetic reproductions to flop twice as often).

The script here is procedural instead of relatable, articulating the future actions of the crew instead of delving into character thru conflict. Alien development becomes absurd in this film, interfering with viewer suspension of disbelief. Lacking in cast interaction, missing interesting subplots and void of any subtlety whatsoever, ""Alien Romulus"" devolves into a semi-enjoyable popcorn flick that lacks any meaning or nuance. For many of us, this is a major disappointment. On the other hand, Romulus has been quickly embraced by the majority, earning more than four times its budget at the box office.",5.0,1,6,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'cinematography', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.5647044777870178}",EMPTY
Alien: Romulus,"Exciting Fan Service That Doesn't Capture The Original ""Alien"" Horror","Alien: Romulus (hereafter ""A:R"") isn't necessarily a bad film depending on what sort of audience you are and if you can weigh the context of current film-making trends and audience generational gaps. I suspect new/young fans of the Alien franchise will find A:R to be exciting and intriguing. Older, returning fans (such as myself) might be a bit jaded as to its offerings.

For those older fans, we may have heard that A:R ""recaptures"" the horror of the franchise. I disagree. Speaking of Alien (1979) in particular, the horror came from subtlety, minimalism, and mystery. While there are sparse moments in A:R that are quiet/silent, most of its tension is built with action. Audio stings and visual jump scares were heavily relied upon. Rather than sitting on its scenes, quietly letting them breathe and build feelings of vulnerability in the audience, A:R rushes us from one shock to the next with racing visuals, panning cameras, and swelling choral music. This is exciting, I admit, but does not preserve the actual horror of the franchise.

The story was serviceable as long as you're okay with characters and plot taking a back seat to pure spectacle. We get pulled forcefully by our noses through a ham-fisted setup that does no more than check the boxes we need to keep the film moving. Getting invested is another matter. As of 24 hours post-viewing, I only remember the names of 3 characters and I can give you two reasons why: One, the audio balancing was poor and it was hard to make out dialogue amidst the ambience and music, and two, the characters were designed as a means to an end. As long as you're viewing for the spectacle and not the plot/characters, you'll have a good time and to heck with names.

Other aspects of the writing were also flawed. The story explains itself too much. Details of the xenomorph were fleshed out when we didn't really need them - maybe this is interesting material, but the more we know, the less mystery we're left with. Also, in terms of dialogue, there were egregious moments that shirk the ""Show, Don't Tell"" maxim of story writing. We didn't need to be told why a particular character is behaving the way they are with an immediate side bar conversation; just give us context clues, maybe a meaningful reveal later. It's as if Fede Alvarez - who is credited as screenwriter as well as director and executive producer - believes his audience to be simple-minded and in need of hand-holding.

As to the casting, there are some lamentations on the characters' ages. Having seen the setup, I think it's fine and didn't bother me throughout the film. The acting is generally decent, though very little is noteworthy outside David Jonsson's work. The moments that felt flattest were often marred by editing. Also, did we need a deep fake for a nostalgia fix? I won't spoil who, but you'll know when you see it, and it looks awful and tasteless.

What did NOT look awful and tasteless were the visuals. The scenes of space may have taken away the claustrophobia of the original Alien film, but the beauty of the ice rings and planetary atmosphere was a delight. Had this been a different kind of movie that focused on sci-fi space travel, I would've had a better time watching it. Visual effects throughout the film were overall impressive, often made better by use of practical effects over abundant CGI. Again, if you're of a mind that can enjoy spectacle without meaningful plot and characters, you'll dine well on A:R.

I should conclude this review before I start writing out a play-by-play video essay: I personally found A:R to be ""okay."" It did the things it clearly wanted to do well. But as an older fan of the franchise, I felt no meaningful connection to this film and would have been content if it was never made. I didn't need an Alien:Romulus. I'm not sure I need any new Alien movies at all.

Similarly to Civil War, you really don't know anything that's happening and it's kind of frustrating.

It's very like A Quiet Place in terms of the monsters. They look kind of similar and have pretty similar abilities. This is most likely due to the fact that the writer wrote both A Quiet Place and Elevation. The Death Angels are still far more dangerous than the Reapers though.

Elevation,Where Logic and Entertainment Hit Rock Bottom,"""Elevation"" is a flat and uninspired attempt at suspense that never manages to lift itself beyond its uninspiring premise. The film's major problem is its lack of intrigue and creativity-every scene feels predictable, with no surprises or memorable moments to hold your attention.

The characters are painfully one-dimensional and make nonsensical decisions throughout the movie, making it hard to root for any of them. Their actions feel more like a way to move the plot forward than authentic human responses, leaving the viewer disconnected from their fates.

And let's talk about the so-called ""climax."" It's hard to even call it that, given how dull and underwhelming it was. There's no payoff, no moment of genuine excitement or tension. It's just there, plodding along like the rest of the movie.

The concept of the monsters being unable to climb above 8,000 feet is laughably unexplained. How does that even work? Are they bound by some arbitrary atmospheric rule? The movie introduces this bizarre limitation but never bothers to provide any reasoning behind it, leaving a gaping hole in the already thin plot.

Last Night on Earth,Review for Last Night On Earth,"This was a movie that I got the chance to check when the X account for Uncork'd Entertainment reached out to me. Their PR rep then sent over the screener link to see this. Now this isn't a horror movie. I knew that coming in. Since this has darker elements and a bleak synopsis, I decided to watch this for review.

Synopsis: faced with impending doom from a planet-killing asteroid, a couple flee to the hills of Tennessee to spend their last days together - but the chaotic breakdown of society disrupts their peaceful plans.

Now our couple from the synopsis are Holly (Leven Rambin) and Ryan (Jake McLaughlin). We see them as they're staying in an RV near a lake. Through radio broadcasts and flashbacks to 7 months before, we know that NASA discovered a large asteroid heading toward Earth. There is a news report about how this is going to be an apocalyptic event, much like what happened to the dinosaurs. It is through this couple's interactions and seeing different things, we learn more about them both.

There are others staying nearby as well. Holly and Ryan find a couple that we got to meet before shifting over to them. There were parents with their son. The stress of what was coming got to be too much for them. We see there is a cult living nearby, led by Carla (Dee Wallace). Our couple also meets with a couple, Gene (Shane West) and Gabby (Sohvi Rodrigeuz), who seem nice. This can be deceiving with the impending end of the world though.

What I'll say about this film is that I like the tone that it sets. We don't necessarily know that the world is ending until the end of the first night in the timeline. This feels like Lars Von Trier's Melancholia. This isn't as stylized as that was and there is more in that other movie that it delves into. What we're getting here is the stark realism of how people would handle the end of the world. It is terrifying that there is a countdown as to when the impact will happen. We see how people react to their own mortality.

I'll stick with our couple and through their flashbacks, we learn different things. They know something is up at a party for Vicky (Katie Keene), when her new boyfriend of Brad (Jackson Davis), takes a call and leaves in a hurry. Ryan asks if Holly wants to change their plans to see her mother before the world ends. That one stuck with me as it seemed like there was a fallout of sorts. There also is a dark side and issues that Holly is dealing with. It is depression and low self-esteem.

Something else I like is the world building. We hear on the radio calling for conspiracies. That is a good touch with this day and age that we live in. I also like incorporating in this religious group. These are all troupes that you'd expect from this sub-genre. It does make it feel generic, I'll be honest there. There were things that I saw coming.

Let me then shift over to discuss the acting. I thought that Rambin and McLaughlin were fine. The biggest issue is that I don't know if I feel much emotion, which is driving on the fact that they're living in a bleak world that is ending soon. There is something with Holly that I can forgive when it is revealed as to why for her. West was solid in his role. I thought that he does what he can to develop his character from where we see him to where he ends up. Rodriguez is a bit over the top, which made it more obvious. It doesn't ruin anything. I did like seeing Wallace here. I'm a fan of hers. Other than that, the rest of the cast was fine for what was needed.

All that is left is filmmaking. I'd say that this is made well enough. Setting in this in what looks like a national park is a good move. That limits the cast that we need. The sequences we got in the city were fine. I like these for framing the state of the world. There did seem to be CGI used. No major issues there. We don't get much in the way of effects, but the practical ones were good. The soundtrack fit what was needed. I did like the use of the radio at different times to fill in back-story or to show where we are.

In conclusion, this was a solid film. The biggest issue is that this doesn't do enough to set itself apart from others. I think that is going to cause this to get lost in the shuffle. The bleak feel was my favorite part. The acting was fine. No one is great, but I've seen worse. This is made well enough from the cinematography, setting to the framing. Not one that I can recommend to everyone. There are just ones doing the same thing better. This is still worth a watch though if you like movies like this.

What makes the film even more compelling is its tribute to an extraordinary individual who championed forward-thinking ideas about quantum mechanics and the nature of time. The dedication to exploring these profound scientific concepts sets it apart, weaving together philosophy and physics in a way that feels both ambitious and engaging.

I'm especially intrigued by the film's potential to expand its narrative in future installments. There's so much room to delve deeper into the nature of time, its relativity, and its role in shaping human experience. Exploring dimensions beyond our three-dimensional perspective could unlock fascinating discussions about the origins of consciousness and the cyclical nature of existence.

As expected, there's Upendra's signature style of screenplay which engages the audience. 1st half of the film and initial parts of the 2nd half move smoothly, banking on Upendra's screen presence and Ajaneesh Loknath's bgm. Near the end it loses the pace and bores a bit.

The jailbreaking sequence was interesting and the scenes in darkness were visually good. But other visuals weren't upto the mark, still not bad considering the low budget. Don't expect this to be an out of the box story though, all the magic of UI just lies in Upendra's direction and Ajaneesh Loknath's BGM where there's a deeper meaning to each character's behaviour.

It has message to society to not get lost in the games played by the media and to find their ""Focus"". I couldn't understand all the hidden meanings but few of them were easy to catch.

UI,"A timely message for Indians from Uppi, but he messed up the script and direction","The movie tells the story of India and its socio-political-cultural landscape without holding back anything.

In the hands of pre-Super Uppi, this ""message"" would have turned into a sharp and clever movie. But UI comes off silly and childish, void of even a hint of classic Uppi's clever story/screenplay, wits and hard-hitting dialogues.

UI,"A mirror, but a shattered one.","Upendra's directorial movies are the ones which me and most of the Karnataka audience always look forward to. His movies have always been very special and unique cinematic experiences and not for everyone. Post early 2000s he ""officially"" directed only 2 movies Super (2009) and Uppi 2 (2015). While the former had a political narrative, the latter a psychological one. Both movies were entertaining and quirky in their own ways. While Super received largely positive responses, Uppi 2 was not received well by everyone because of its confusing narrative. Upendra continues his confusing narrative theme with the latest release UI (Universal Intelligence as he calls it eventually in the movie).

The movie not only did not have any major promotions but also did not have any well structured promotional content. It could be the choice of Upendra or we can also interpret whether he was still making some decisions on the final output. The 'Troll Song' which is kind of integrated into the movie has very new meme references which have been trending in 2024. Considering this movie has started in 2022, Troll song could be a part of many changes that the script has undergone along the way. The movie as expected is very much metaphorical and runs haywire from one narrative to another. The movie does not have a very good structure in its narration and just throws different scenes at us. It is very easy to defend the movie saying not everyone understood the movie and hence it can't be judged how good it is. It is probably difficult to judge this movie for its story and its ultimate goal, but it can definitely be judged for its making and the entertainment factor.

The movie works better when it is mocking the current political and socio economic scenarios. Especially in the first half where the movie draws parallel to reality and also hits some funny parody references. Once the movie moves into the fictional dystopian world, the movie gets over dramatic and confusing. The scenes constantly keep shifting from Upendra's one character to another with a weird editing pattern. You can sense that Upendra is trying to address certain metaphors with two different shades of characters but it seems messy. It also feels like the movie may have been rewritten during the shooting. There are some visually appealing scenes in the movie but they are overshadowed by confusing camerawork at times and a not so great background score. The producers and Upendra have constantly stated the delay in movie release was due to the VFX work. While VFX isn't that bad, it definitely doesn't justify the delay and push in the release date. The starting credits of the movie are way too fast and seem only for formality. However, the movie's title drops in a very cool manner.

UI is Upendra's one man show but unfortunately it barely touches his acting capabilities which we had seen in his directorials A, Upendra or Uppi 2. There are other popular Kannada actors whose roles seem like they are part of a play rather than a movie. I feel that there should have been a better tribute to the late director Guruprasad who has played a role in the movie.

UI is Upendra's political and social thoughts thrown at the audience in a very haphazard manner. The movie feels like an extended and confusing version of his Super movie scene where he mocks the complacent Indian citizen. To be honest this movie could have worked better in a mockumentary format, something like Borat.

The film's end is (and has to be) message-less, because, if there is a message, then the Director wouldn't be practicing what he preached .. Find your own way.

We can carve our unique way through life, but not through UI's reels, realistic or 'reel'istic.

UI is not for people who carelessly judge Upendra's films and the thinking behind it. You have to remove your sophistication and class masks to even begin to understand UI. There is no enjoying UI, because introspection and enjoyment can't coexist. The after-hours of UI are as muddled and indigestible as the premise of humanity's future as portrayed in UI. But one thing is for sure. We don't deserve any better.

Also, however naive or hypocritical viewers are, one thing is very clear .. We have assaulted mother earth like no other yuga in its history. Welcome to the jungle.

Despicable Me 4,Familiar fun with a few new twists,"""Despicable Me 4,"" the latest installment in the beloved animated franchise, delivers more of the same zany antics and heartwarming moments that fans have come to expect. Gru, voiced by Steve Carell, returns with his lovable Minions in tow, ready to embark on yet another wild adventure.

The movie introduces a few new characters, adding fresh dynamics to the familiar mix. The plot, while somewhat predictable, is packed with enough humor and action to keep viewers entertained. The Minions, as always, steal the show with their slapstick comedy and nonsensical chatter, providing plenty of laughs for both kids and adults.

However, ""Despicable Me 4"" struggles to break new ground. The storylines feel recycled at times, and the emotional beats, though effective, lack the impact of earlier films. The animation quality remains top-notch, and the voice performances are consistently strong, ensuring that the film is enjoyable even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors.

Overall, ""Despicable Me 4"" is a fun, family-friendly movie that offers a good time, despite its familiarity and lack of innovation.",6.0,50,10,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8982654213905334}",Positive
Despicable Me 4,Wasted Time. Find another movie.,"This is not a movie, this is a product. The producer does not care if you are entertained, they only want you seated.

The movie is composed of multiple, disjointed scenarios. This is so they can keep your attention without putting any effort into writing. When you reach the border of painful disinterest they switch to another boring and mundane scenario.

The visuals are realistic. They are not *good*, they are realistic. What is the difference? Life is realistic yet it is not inherently interesting. This movie is a series of colours that appear and disappear, without any content.

The rendering is good but the animation is awful. There is no ounce of expression, it's like every character is made of cardboard. The minions themselves are better treated, because they are more abstract and cartoonish.

The soundtrack is disjointed with the movie. You might as well play your own music at this rate.

The movie is too long, believe it or not. It's not too long for an audience, because it's only an hour and a half, it's too long for *itself*. Everything drags on too long because it needs to meet a feature length film duration. Considering it's real content, it would only make it around half an hour. It might of even been a better movie at that length.

The film was beyond unacceptable. I can forgive a neutral or bland movie, because at it's core it does no harm, but this one does. This one harmed me, it gave me a headache, chest pains and back pain because my mind was so numb that I couldn't even bother to move. I watched the whole thing because I didn't want to judge it unfairly. I thought the thing was two hours and a half long! Even children find the movie boring. Who makes this?

I don't understand how hard it is to write something that at least interests the artists themselves. Why do I keep seeing the essence of the 60-something chairmen in every meter of film? Even the music - Karma Chameleon as the film's ending? If you were ten years old in 1983, you would be Fifty today. That's not a parental age gap, that's pushing the retirement house! Parents today are in their late twenties to thirties. Does this not tell you just how old and out of touch these chairmen and producers are? The nostalgia is for the Nineties at *most*, I can assure you a very limited number of people today look to the Eighties with nostalgia, and they are not nearly as likely to be in the audience.

And this brings me to the final gripe. You are making a movie that runs on Nostalgia. The audience who watched your first movie were children in 2010. Why then, are you making products for those in aged care? How stupid do you truly have to be, to not realise that the ""parents"" you are trying to be inclusive of, are the very same children of yesteryear? I'll tell you how stupid you have to be. You have to be as stupid as a company run by greying men who can't keep their own stupid ideas out of the hands of artists. They think they know what creative work is, but confuse it for a personal fantasy. Stop letting businessmen direct.

I've been very gracious with the five stars. This movie does not deserve to even be considered.

Despicable Me 4,Dangerous grandma wow,"I saw the movie and I would like to say that it's not bad, but I think it's missing and wrong in many things. It was quite short and it almost seemed to have a rushed narrative. I didn't really understand what Gru was trying to do, there was a villain and it wasn't clear what he was trying to do. The old woman and the red-haired girl were unnecessary. There were almost no girls in the movie, it would have been better if they at least grew up. I know this movie is for kids, but wouldn't showing something good make them grow up more?

It has a world built on exaggeration from the beginning. So there is no point in saying anything about the exaggeration part. I recommend you to watch it.

Despicable Me 4,A bland and pointless cash grab,"POSITIVES:

1) The film certainly has some chuckle-worthy moments, especially revolving around the minions
2) The animation is very well done and there are some fun action set pieces with some amusing visuals
3) Look, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't grinning a lot and actually getting quite emotional when it came to the happy ending of Junior finally saying ""Dada"", Lucky the goat coming home, and the Everybody Wants To Rule The World singing sequence where we see some of the villains from the previous films
4) I appreciated all of the pop culture references that the film had, particularly when it came to referencing other films

NEGATIVES:

1) As the title of this review states, the film just feels so unnecessary. It adds nothing to the series and really just creates the feeling that this series ran out of steam a long time ago
2) Whilst I did chuckle at times, the film is nowhere near as funny as it ought to be. There were no proper laugh out loud moments, there were only light chuckles, and I found the humour and the script in general to just overall be disappointing
3) Will Ferrell's accent was so infuriating to me. I really don't get why he couldn't have just spoken in his regular accent? I thought this weird Eastern European accent he was doing was honestly painful at times
4) The original kids all felt completely irrelevant in this film, as all the screen time goes to newcomers Junior and Poppy instead. The film occasionally hints at subplots, like high school bullying, but then completely ignores them and never goes anywhere with it? In general I think the film just felt really badly written and also completely over stuffed with characters, meaning that people like the original kids, as well as characters like Valentina, just feel completely cut out.",5.0,2,0,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.5668286085128784}",EMPTY
Despicable Me 4,Ruined my childhood,"Despicable Me 1 from 2010 was a funny, somewhat inappropriate but in a good way, and original film. Despicable Me 4 has turned the whole thing upside down by being the biggest brain rot ever. With a plot that appears in movies with 2 star ratings, this is the absolute death of the franchise. What makes the old movies enjoyable was the the fact. That it didn't follow social norms. What Universal Studios did here was to follow mainstream social media and try to appease to and not offend groups like the LGBTQ+ community and BLM community, completely ignoring the fact that this movie was supposed to be funny in its own way. There are way to many subplots to this and it takes out the despicable part. Universal Studios just ruined my entire childhood. Also, most of the jokes was inappropriate in some ways, but it was more like hitting your private parts inappropriate, which to be honest is probably worse for a younger audience.

I feel like movies are going back to their roots - being an escape from reality for a few hours and Despicable Me 4 is heading in the right direction, which, ironically, is back.

I am giving it the max possible score because the overall seems too low for the movie that it is. Yes, it may not be the best in the series, but it's amazing, compared to recent movies.

The main villain of the film is a cockroach who isn't threatening even though he is apparently so much of a threat that the main cast have to go into hiding. The villain if this film is no threat when compared to other villains from the other films. His motivation is also flawed as he is pissed at hey for being a meanie bum in school, this apparently gives fry full right to kidnap a child. The film also includes the mega minions which are the most pointless characters to ever exist as they are there just to sell rl toys. Also there is no climax to the film as it is the villain falling off a building and getting ran over by random things from the mega minions. The film is also full of pointless subplots like a hair dressing one that ends in a supermarket chase and a neighbor plot that ends in a boring tennis match. And a karate subplot that has no follow-up scenes. Also there is some spazy ginger with a lisp. There is only three redeeming aspects the animation and the voice acting and the soundtrack.

Social media addiction, self-expression compulsion, luxury affinity, technology dependency. These poor kids, who are now grown up but will probably never be emotionally, are trapped in this world of fake bits and fake bytes.

As the film progresses, it becomes difficult to follow the who-is-who, especially because the characters don't play favourites. Presumably they all remain strangers to the audience. At some point, however, there is a good trick for the danger of confusion. In general, the makers come up with all kinds of technical gimmicks to support their vision. Confusion? Yes, often, but the interesting bodyswitch theme also ensures that the suspense is maintained.

These films are staying from black humor and prior used antics and going for more dark topics and themes. The particular film exploring virtual reality based on personal traumas and fantasies.

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part Two,"A heroine, a villain and a destiny for both","Continuing the plot of Crisis On Infinity Earths, this second part focuses on two characters that are going to play a very important role in the trilogy and may end up being meaningless to viewers. The first part only focused on Barry Allen and offered clues about something very important involving Barry. This second part focuses on Kara Zor-El and Charles Halstead because of the crucial role they will end up playing in this trilogy. First the movie tells how a variant of Kara Zor-El ended up under the care of The Monitor and ended up becoming Harbinger. This can be confusing because Kara Zor-El and Harbinger are two different characters in the comics and here they decided to merge them. The interesting thing is that there is a development that helps The Monitor feel empathy for others. The Monitor had said that those of his kind should not intervene in the affairs of parallel realities, but the story we see here helps to understand why The Monitor decided to intervene. Then we have a conversation between Charles Halstead and Doctor Fate in which Charles explains his origin. While he only had a brief appearance in the previous part, here we get to know the character better. After that, the battle against The Anti-Monitor finally begins and we see how this trilogy begins to relate the Tomorrowverse with the other universes of DC Comics animated productions. We already had that hint in the first part through the cameos, but here it becomes more evident when we see Batman together with his son Damian Wayne from the DCAMU, Barbara Gordon and Terry McGinnis from the DCAU. Although it may be just as boring as the first part and doesn't offer the answers to what was seen in the beginning, this second part of Crisis On Infinity Earths is a nice movie to continue delving into the multiversal fight of the heroes.

It isn't a bad movie, you root for the character's you're supposed to, it looks great, the action is well done, at times the tension and world building does work extremely well and the story is again the best part.

What the movie suffers from is a lack of focus. There is a human and an ape main character and if had focused more on either it could have been great with the exact same storyline.

The villains are shallow when they didn't have to be. (I think the human story would've made the villains better/more developed as it focuses more on the ape story but that's an opinion you can take or leave).

The storytelling is top-notch, weaving together a compelling narrative that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish.

What sets this movie apart is its remarkable attention to detail in creating the ape civilization. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, bringing to life a world where apes rule with stunning realism. From the lush landscapes to the intricate ape society, every aspect feels meticulously crafted and immersive.

But beyond the spectacle, ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" delves into deeper themes, exploring complex issues like power dynamics, societal structure, and the moral dilemmas that arise when different species coexist. It's a movie that not only entertains but also sparks meaningful conversations long after the credits roll.

The performances are stellar across the board, with the cast fully embracing their roles and bringing depth to their characters. Whether it's the charismatic ape leader or the human protagonists fighting for survival, each actor delivers a memorable performance that adds layers to the story.",10.0,112,120,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,0,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9878296852111816}",Positive
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,Kingdom of Moses of the planet of Noah,"While an interesting story, and a well shot movie, sadly the writers borrowed heavily from biblical tales, including Noah and the flood. Ironic if you think about it, since there was an actual flood they had to deal with.

As well, the movie gives us a future supposedly 300 years hence.... with scenery that looks like it should be 1000 or more years. Seriously, I was watching this and thinking that the timeline was more akin to Horizon Zero Dawn.... then I pull up interviews and articles that proclaim only 300 years have passed.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,KOTPOTA Review,"It was a film that took off life 300 years after the death of Ceasar. It showed how Apes ruled the world, and a new intelligent Ape came along who only saw peace between the apes his name is Noa. Apes split across the country until they were all gathered by one Who took this power the wrong way his name was Proximus Ceaser. On Noas journey to get his village back he learns about the legacy of Ceaser and the importance of Humans and Apes living together but must stop the power hungry Apes if necessary.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,A very compelling follow up,"""What a wonderful day"" indeed! Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is yet another strong entry in the Planet of the Apes franchise. I was both relieved and thrilled by how much I enjoyed it, even compared to the last nearly-perfect trilogy. I pretty much loved Kingdom, an action-spectacle that's shockingly mostly about how history and myth can empower or destroy while probing what we'll do to survive. There are flaws, such as the pacing, but it still lives up to the quality of the Matt Reeves/Andy Serkis films. Between Rise, Dawn, War, and now Kingdom, this series continues to be one of the very best franchise reboots out there. Wes Ball wisely takes his time establishing the state of the planet set many generations after the last film, exploring how the Christ-like legend of Caesar has spread for both good and evil, and introducing us to new characters we grow to care about. Ball directed the hell out of this, balancing painterly postcard-style shots with handheld, allowing the scale, beauty, and depth of the world to make an impact while the verisimilitude of a reactive camera hooks you in. It's everything a VFX-heavy blockbuster should be and is a tremendous visual feat with the best visual effects seen in a movie since Avatar: The Way Of Water while never once wavering from its emotional core.

Ball is also an ace with casting and working with actors. It was abundantly clear in the Maze Runner movies (even if the movies themselves are so-so), and now the same is true here, too. Owen Teague gives his whole heart to Noa, and you can feel it. Freya Allan is a powerhouse as Mae, one of the most fascinating characters to track. And I truly can't imagine a better casting for Proximus Caesar than Kevin Durand. (The only downside to Durand being such a force in that role? I wanted more of him. In fact, I'd watch a whole prequel film covering how he developed his perception of humankind and came into power.)

Josh Friedman's script is really interested in exploring the legacy that Ceasar left behind, which I found very compelling. He's revered as a Jesus-type figure and I really liked how different factions interpret his legacy differently. Some for good, others for bad. It feels very reflective of our real-world history, and how leaders in our time and the past weaponize religion to fit their interests. This is an original story that feels like a natural progression of what came before. Setting the story hundreds of years after War was a brilliant choice. It's fascinating to see what's become of Caesar's impact on the apes, but it also ensures anyone can watch and enjoy this particular installment. I'm also a big fan of how intimate and character-first the events of the film feel, while still clearly conveying how deeply profound and significant they are. The biggest reason I love this film, even considering all of its technical brilliance, is the story- the core idea behind this movie is why it works. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes takes place decades after the reign of Caesar in which we now see a complete societal role reversal: apes lead, humans follow. It's a simple premise that lends itself to so many subplots and narratives, one of which is the shadow of Caesar over the new generation of apes. I consider Kingdom to be a quintessential summer blockbuster- the set design, CGI, and rich storytelling is the exact type of film I'm looking for in an early summer release. It really feels like a classic Hollywood adventure flick!

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a worthy successor to the throne. A bold leap into the future of this world that hooked me immediately. It's a genuinely exciting action adventure, perhaps larger in scope than the last films, but just as grounded in honest emotion. Of course, it's thrilling and filled with breathtaking visuals, but it's also full of fascinating questions about humanity, history, and what's next. It does have more of a ""blockbuster"" vibe than the artistry of Dawn and War, but that's not a knock. This is a great time. Kingdom feels like the start of an epic new saga. I need to see the next one ASAP! It's fitting that this franchise continues to find smart new ways to evolve, even or especially as the rest of Hollywood grows that much dumber around it.",8.0,2,1,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'actor', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9506031274795532}",Positive

A quest that will find him learning about the past of his kind and pondering existential themes.

Wes Ball's Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a profound and nuanced study of prejudice, ethics, and humanity that problematizes ape-human coexistence after Caesar. This is expertly achieved due to the fact that, like its predecessors, it doesn't take sides. There are many ""What if...?"" moments that place us before questions about the nature of our species.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,It was interesting and Caesar's place was empty.,"After the success of the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy, a sequel seemed inevitable, but there were always concerns about the legacy of Caesar and the three films being lost. Making a new installment of the series without Caesar, with a new story and characters, and without the stars and creators of the first three films is undoubtedly a high risk, and Wes Ball, who previously directed the Maze Runner trilogy, has accepted that risk.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is set to take place almost 300 years after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes, and the film is being described as the beginning of a new saga in the Planet of the Apes universe.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,Epic in scale but not in story,"You have to give the production team credit. The CGI in this movie is impressive. It's hard to tell where the line between real scenery and performers ends and the digital world begins. There are a handful of shots that don't convince in terms of lighting and movement, but fortunately the film avoids the ""augmented reality"" look of a superhero blockbuster.

Sadly the story and pacing aren't quite up to scratch.

The first hour is more akin to a nature documentary - the kind that films animals in the wild and then gets a B-list celebrity to narrate an imagined story of what they are doing. In this case there isn't any narration but there is a very long showcase of the CGI world before any relevant action takes place. This slows the whole film down.

Once the action begins, the momentum picks up. And some of the action scenes are very good, fast paced and with a real sense of danger. Personally speaking I find it hard to fully engage when there is so much pixel-manipulation on screen, but I feel the same about most modern CGI films.

However the story doesn't quite hit the mark. As is the tradition in Planet of the Apes movies, it meditates on humanity's destructive nature, with some slightly unexpected plot developments in the final act. But by the end, you can't help wondering whether the path taken by young ape Noa and human Mae was really worth the effort - they could have got to their intended destination with far less risk. There is a hint of a sequel in the works which may explain why the story feels slightly abstract.

With a shorter runtime and a more focused plot this might have been an above-average popcorn movie.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,Impressive CGI can't hide a dull formuleaic plot,"This is the fourth instalment of the 'Apes' franchise and it's fair to say it has some 'big shoes' to follow. But the source material remains a rich seam for some writers to create a compelling, original and entertaining addition to the genre.

Set some generations after Caesar's death the film is set in a world where nature has taken over the crumbling vestiges of man, buildings crumble, overgrown with tropical foliage, rusted ship hulks sit on shorelines. And yet, locked away in an old military bunker is a wealth of military hardware seemingly untouched by years of neglect. And against this backdrop we are introduced to our characters, a group of young and somewhat dull apes, a young human girl who can miraculously speak when the vast majority of humankind have regressed to mute savages, and a megalomanic ape warlord.

So remove the CGI and we have a standard plot, some irritating and unexplained paradoxes and a film that lacks anything really gripping. Indeed, I had to watch this in the sittings as I found it dull and kept flicking to other things. The set pieces are predictable, the story arc slow and the characters bland.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,7 and a half really.,"I am a big fan of the Rise/Dawn/War trilogy and went into this with an open mind and I admit I did enjoy it. Although I probably won't see it a second time in the cinema.

It was clearly written to have sequels and as such a large chunk of the time is spent setting up characters and story lines that you know you won't see the end of for a few years.

It's a little generic in places and it's an amazing coincidence that the only human has supermodel looks but these can be forgiven in a well crafted, foundation setting story that will be built on over the rest of the decade and hopefully explore Caesar's full legacy in greater depth.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,A Good Follow-Up to the Caesar Trilogy,"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the latest film in the current Apes franchise. It's essentially a soft reboot. While still in the same continuity as the Caesar Trilogy, it's set years after the previous film with a new protagonist in a very changed world where the apes reign supreme. Of all the films coming out this year, I was most excited for this one. I'm not a diehard Planet of the Apes fan. I've seen the original classic, the Tim Burton version, and this more recent continuity of films. Of this current timeline, I think Rise of the Planet of the Apes is okay, but I love Dawn of the Apes. That film is what made me a fan of the franchise. War for the Apes is also great. So, when I first saw the trailer for this film, I got excited. For the most part, this movie is good, but I have some concerns.

As usual, the effects and cinematography are gorgeous, which should come as no surprise if you've seen the last two installments. I do like our new cast of characters, particularly our new protagonist, Noah. Caesar is a tough act to follow, but I think Noah does an adequate job filling those shoes. The main villain Proxima is also good, and I wish we got a bit more of him. The premise of this movie is exactly what I wished for this franchise to go after War for the Apes. It's about the apes' dominion over the Earth and setting up new societies of their own in humanity's absence, and all the trials and tribulation that come with that. However, this is when we get to my concerns.

While the human characters in this film aren't bad, I felt their stories weren't as interesting as our lead ape characters. Plus, the revelation at the very end has me a bit concerned about the franchise going forward. It feels like we're starting to retread old ground from the last couple films.

This new batch of Apes movies should be all about the apes and their struggles with being the new dominant species on the planet. It should be like Game of Thrones with apes. Most of this movie was about that, but now it seems we're moving in another direction that we've already seen played out.

I think it all has to do with this stupid mindset Hollywood has where the audience won't be invested unless human characters in some significant role. This is a mindset that had also held the Transformers franchise down. The Monsterverse also suffers from this, though to a lesser degree. You don't need characters to be human to get invested in them. You just need them to act human and be interesting characters. These Apes movies have proven this time and again, as the apes have always been the most interesting characters.

I hope I'm wrong about this. Unlike those other franchises I mentioned, these Apes movies have always done a good job at subverting my expectations and are good at balancing the human drama, whilst keeping the main focus on the apes.

Overall, this film is a solid continuation that honors what came before. I don't think it's as good as Dawn or War for the Apes, but it is good and worth watching if you're a fan of this franchise. I'd say it's worth seeing on the big screen too.",8.0,3,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'cinematography', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7623708844184875}",EMPTY

I was constantly trying to figure out some of the apes voices because I recognised them, but I failed miserably, but when I checked the credits I noticed Kevin Durand was one of them, his voice is quite unique.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,A Kingdom Of Potential and Quality,"LIKES:

Spectacular Animation

Great Sound Editing

Fantastic Writing/Dialog

Wonderful world-building Story

Acting Is Beautiful

Very Deep And Sets Up Lots Of Plots

Summary:
The start of the likes involves the production quality that Ball's team brought to the screen. Kingdom's animation is beautiful, motion capture at its finest with a blend of reality and CGI coming together in ways that may not completely erase the line between worlds, but make it miniscule. The characters hold many astounding details, movements captured in surprising accuracy, textures that change as they are affected by the environment, and emotions that somehow blend humans and apes into one. Accompanying the visuals are sound effects and editing, and come together to bring out that primal fury that comes with every grunt, groan, and roar of the dominating forces. The sounds are not distracting, but rather accessories that help convey each person's emotions, which supports the strong writing packed into this film.

Past the production quality, the story is impressive for a first installment into the next trilogy of this movie franchise. Kingdom is a world-building movie bridging the audience to the next arc of this franchise as they shape the direction of this franchise. They present elements of the old to remind us of the previous trilogy but never get lost in the past to distract the movie from Noa's quest to explore the world. The writers made Kingdom its own film, building from the foundation to make something that can be an exciting trilogy depending on the sequels to come. A deep narrative that explores so much and integrates these pieces into a movie that flowed and came off natural as the next wave of evolution occurred, bringing with it several plots to pursue in the next installment. The dialog carries a lot of the film in the philosophical debates of existence, humanity, and character, yet seldom got caught up in corny monologues or soap opera temper tantrums. And the actors and actresses who spoke those words were true testaments to their trades. I won't call out individual names, but human and ape actors had such chemistry and conveyed the tension between the two species and their beliefs. Assuming they were the ones acting in the motion capture suits, the actors certainly showed off their physical and verbal performances to match the magnitude of the animation effects.

DISLIKES:

Long

Slow AT Times

Needs Some Action Like The Prequels

William H Macy Needed More Involvement

A Tad Predictable.

Where The Plot Will Match

SUMMARY
The movie is long and at times it did feel like it was two-and-half hours with where it dragged (especially during the transitions between acts). That slow aspect was tough at times as we meandered through the dialog that we had heard several times by that point was annoying, but tolerable and fortunately not as frequent as I've seen in other movies. A bit of action could have helped mitigate some of these time-dilation moments and spice things up as Rise of the Planet of the Apes did for me. Sure, some moments are exciting, but the centuries have dampened the action a bit and require another movie to potentially get to the action that had me smiling in delight. Outside of that, the movie's plot has a lot of predictability in the foreshadowing dialogue and focused scenes. Nothing that destroys my enjoyment of the character development, but again could have used just a tad more surprise to bring that wow factor. William H. Macy could have had a more engaging character arc as well, given the potential they were building with him, but alas his character had more of a metaphorical use than I would have liked. Finally, the plot is exciting with the vast directions they can take with the story, but at the same time, I'm not quite sure where or how it will connect to the first movie that started it all. Is that a bad thing? I guess it depends on the type of fan, but the fact there are still plenty of years between them offers some leniency. Still, very interesting with the vague direction where we can go.

The VERDICT:
The latest movie of Planet Of the Apes is a wonderful promise of an engaging, character-driven story that will be worth the investment in the future. A solid focus on storytelling and worldbuilding, Kingdom establishes a fracture point to take the series into a new direction that may never cross the original, and does so with a deeper lore than I had anticipated from the trailers. With great dialogue, writing, and acting to sell it, this movie really shines in the quality of a believable relationship between man and ape that is intriguing to watch. As for the production quality, it is a prime specimen of Hollywood evolution that I hardly encourage to be seen in theaters, preferably Imax, for the fantastic visuals and high-definition sound. Sure I myself wanted more action to help speed up and handle the longer run-time of the movie, and perhaps some better use of some actors. Yet, that's about all I can point at for this film and feel this is a solid film to see:

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,The rare fourth film that surpasses the solid trilogy that came before it.,"With how difficult it is to pull of a trilogy that doesn't have any significantly bad entries, it's almost impossible to make a successful movie that sits as the fourth entry outside that trilogy. Plenty of ""fourth"" films never hit the mark their predecessor trilogy did. This was why I had to roll my eyes when Hollywood added another movie on top of the already well-done Planet of the Apes prequel trilogy. Well, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024) proved me wrong.

By giving itself enough distance from the Caesar story arc, Kingdom threads that needle that connects the lead-up events to the very first film in the franchise. Even if most of the fundamental concepts have already been covered in this franchise, there are still enough surprising moments here to make it an excellent entry-which is also what made the original 1968 movie so memorable. It truly felt as if the audience was getting the understanding of the original movie's plot through the viewpoint of the apes this time.

What's perhaps the most important point with Kingdom is how relevant it is to today's society. Sure, there were a lot of great action and battle sequences, but underneath everything is a society that's founded on hero worship. That uses nostalgia and catchy slogans to rally apes to their cause. If history repeats itself in the real world, then what's to say that we can't see it happen in the Planet of the Apes? While the reboot prequel trilogy was excellent, it paved the way for Kingdom to be absolutely superb.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,Sooo boring,"Absolutely gutted to be honest. Massive fan of the rebooted trilogy so had high hopes for this, sadly unrealised. It all feels way too familiar, and the pacing is dire. I also didn't really connect with any of the characters (unlike the aforementioned trilogy).

The movie started off with a premise and it was to tell a story with great visuals. I was excited until some questions formed in my mind. Maybe it's just me because i am not invested in the entire storyline and my physics are a bit blurry, but here goes:

the movie begins with a line: ""many many generations after Caesar."" and you can see it everywhere: no cities are left, everything is covered in plants and vines (although some claims state that this could happen in a mere decade). My problem with this is pretty clear: how did Mae know how to operate a God damn nuclear bunker and what to take from there? Monkeys seem to not know a lot about humans as well, so I'm taking it as at least a century has passed since the time of Caesar. How is Mae knowledgeable in this area but shocked to see stars?

why did some humans revert to unga bunga times while there are literal astrophysicists and engineers in a bunker? How the hell did they get their education to work satellite dishes if it's been so long since the humans are gone and their mates are hunting (and being hunted) with a leaf covering their butt outside?

how did the guns in the bunker not rust? If they did not, i assume a smart monkey like Proximus could get his hands on a pair of pistols from anywhere else. And it feels kinda cheap to have a backdoor to the bunker and not have a society of apes (which is at least level with the Ancient Egypt) discover it. Also i don't think i'd be too afraid of a couple of apes getting their hands on a couple rifles even if they worked properly because there is no way those vehicles inside work with their fuel evaporated and battery drained. I doubt apes could get their hands on fresh oil too, so who cares if they have a shock stick or a .45 when you're ded either way?",5.0,2,2,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.732761561870575}",EMPTY

The film delves into the story of Charlotte, a 12-year-old girl who forms an unlikely bond with Sting, her pet spider. As their relationship deepens, so does the spider's size, mirroring Charlotte's own fears and anxieties. What starts as a simple tale of a missing pet escalates into a chilling narrative of a family on the verge of collapse.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,Jim Carrey makes this unwatchable and the changes to character backstories disappointed me,"I've been a fan of the Sonic franchise for a long time. I didn't really like the other movies but so many people seemed to like this one I thought I might enjoy it. Shadow the Hedgehog is one of my favorite characters of all time. I've really wanted to see his backstory play out on the big screen. I've never been more disappointed. I walked out about 45 mins in.

They changed everything about his backstory. They made him just an alien that landed on earth and was captured and put in a lab. I think they did this so he would basically be what would Sonic would be like if he was captured on earth instead of ending up with a family. But it took away everything from his story that made it interesting.

Gerald Robotnik created Shadow to try and find a cure for Maria who was sick with a deadly disease. In this Maria isn't sick and Shadow wasn't created by Gerald. Maria is the reason Shadow exists in the games. If Gerald wasn't trying to find a cure for her Shadow wouldn't exist. It really makes their relationship so much less meaningful when she is just some girl who was nice to him and his friend. Maria and Gerald were like his family, Gerald was basically his dad.

They were both tragic characters because they both ended up dead. Gerald just wanted to find a cure for his granddaughter but was killed because of his experiments. His revenge is set in motion even after he dies. He uses Shadow, his creation that he made to help the world to try and destroy it. He was a tragic character who never came across as silly and Jim Carrey absolutely ruins his portrayal.

Maria is killed in the arc raid and saves Shadow as she is dying. Her last wish is for Shadow to protect the earth. Even after everything that happened she still loved the earth and the people in it. Taking away her illness takes away so much from her character. She was always optimistic, kind and loving even though she was suffering with her illness.

And in the movie they are on some base on earth while in the games they were on the Space Colony Arc. I was so excited to see Shadow's backstory on the arc and I didn't get that. Maria is on the arc because the low gravity helps keep her condition in remission. She loves the earth and wants to be there and spends time with Shadow looking at the earth from a window on the arc. They both talk about how much they want to be in earth and what it would be like and it's even more tragic that they don't get to see that together.

Maria dies and 50 years later when Shadow wakes up from stasis his memories have been manipulated and he is planning to destroy the earth for what they did to Maria. Taking away this part of their story ruins both of their characters for me. Having Gerald still be alive so Jim Carrey could be twice as annoying was the worst decision they could have made.

I wish they could have handled it with more maturity. Yes it's a kids movie but kids deserve better than this unfunny trash. Sonic Adventure 2 was a kids game and it handled it better decades ago. Sonic x Shadow Generations is a kids game and it handled it better this year. Dark Beginnings the short animation that came with the game was everything I wish this movie was.

There is nothing in these movies that feel like the Sonic franchise I love. The characters don't feel the same. And Jim Carey is ruined it for me. I don't think they can ever do Sonic right with the way he is in these movies.

Sonic in the games doesn't have a backstory. He is free as the wind, not dragged down by any kind of past, he's a force of nature. And Shadow is burdened by his past, he's a man made creation that contrasts with Sonic's natural abilities.

The movies have given them similar backstories and ruined what made each character unique.",1.0,9,49,sadness,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7823936343193054}",EMPTY

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,"Becoming cringey, worst of the 3. Don't know how it's the highest rated of the 3, we barely made it past the halfway mark...","I absolutely LOVED the first Sonic movie and is one of my all time favorites. I rewatch it constantly. It was a cute story, and the jokes were funny for all ages to get a good many laughs. It was truly a movie the whole family could enjoy.

The second movie was still pretty good, wasn't as funny as the first one and focused more on the action, but still had a few good zingers especially from Knuckles. I enjoyed it but probably won't re watch it as often.

But this third one? Is an embarrassment to the series. The jokes are too predictable and kind of cringe. It feels like the humor of this 3rd movie was written for kids. I understand it's half-animated and the children are a huge market for it, but adults who played Sonic growing up were able to enjoy the other two as well.

I'm a huge Ben Schwartz fan and love almost everything he's in, but his voice acting as sonic in this one was... not good. He did great in the other two movies but in this one almost every sentence Sonic spoke was a one liner with the exact same cadence. I'm not sure how to describe it in writing but almost sounds like he always starts up high emphasizing the beginning of the sentence and dropping down near the end of it but with some ""sass"" that just doesn't fit what Sonic is saying. Some of the jokes might have actually been a little funnier if he said them with a more monotone and was more quick and punchy with the delivery. He didn't voice him this way as much in the first two movies and when he did it was on sentences/jokes that actually made sense so it fit and wasn't jarring.

Jim Carrey is always known for over the top comedic acting and did so in the first two movies but it was almost next level in this entry to the point it was getting hard to watch as well.

The disguises around the halfway point where they kept using different people's faces was extremely corny and come on... I know it's an obviously fictional story with aliens and stuff but at least try to make it a little believable? Have the actual characters voiceover so it's their voices with someone else's face? Might have made it a *little* better.

What pains me is the storylines were actually decent. Especially with Shadow and the girl and part of me wanted to know more about it... but the negative just outweighed the positive far too much. We couldn't do it. My fiance and I were genuinely so offput by all I mentioned above that we just couldn't continue. We got to around 50mins hoping it got better/funnier/or that the action would make up for it... but we just couldn't do it anymore. It's sad because I had such high hopes for this series after the first movie, that first one is probably sitting amongst my all time favorites right now, but it's just strayed too far away from what made that first one so cute and heartfelt and ACTUALLY funny that it doesn't even feel like the same franchise in this one...",1.0,0,0,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.799137532711029}",EMPTY

Parallel,A bit melodramatic for my sci-fi tastes,"Parallel depicts a woman, her husband, and his brother at ther late father's house deep in the woods. There is mention of the father's ""crazy conspiracy theories"" in their secluded area. The three appear to have some tension or conflict between them, especially the husband and wife. To escape this, thr wife goes for a walk into the woods and sees herself with a rifle, and this person shoots at her. The wife displays more emotional unsteadiness following this encounter.

That acting is well crafted if a bit overly emotive, but they are coping with a recent distressful situation. And the confusion of parallel worlds would be distressing as well. Production is good providing for a well-crafted visual prevention of home and woods.

Parallel,Totally enjoyed it!,"Initially skeptical after seeing its unimpressive ratings, I reluctantly decided to watch this multiverse/time travel film after browsing through several user reviews. To my surprise, the movie captivated me with its unique, almost claustrophobic atmosphere, confined to a minimalistic setting with just three characters. Despite its apparent simplicity and limited scope, the film impressively explores its concept, pushing the boundaries of its narrative constraints.

It maintains a delicate balance between innovation and budget constraints, and I found myself wondering if its success was a stroke of luck or a testament to clever filmmaking. Unlike many avant-garde films that tend to meander and conclude on an unsatisfying note, this one managed to weave depth and intrigue throughout, compelling me to invest emotionally in all three protagonists-and their various iterations.

Given the complexity and the slow-burn nature of its storytelling, this movie might not resonate with everyone. It demands the right mood and moment-perhaps catching you in the perfect universe on the perfect evening, as it did with me. That night, I felt rewarded for my patience and was glad to see a film that didn't squander its potential. The industry's standard might hover around mediocrity, but this film stands out, deserving of much more than its initial 4.9 rating.

The Greatest Hits,song sung blue,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are one for whom hearing a particular song, no matter how many times over however many years, brings back vivid memories of a person close to you or a memorable event, then you will likely relate to Harriet, the lead character in this film from writer-director Ned Benson (THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ELEANOR RIGBY, 2014). Additionally, if you have tragically lost someone special to you and find yourself cloaked in unshakeable grief, then you will also likely find common ground with Harriet.

Harriet (Lucy Boynton, so good in SING STREET, 2016) wears noise-cancelling headphones whenever she is in public. She is so concerned with controlling the songs she hears, that she now works in a library for the serenity that silence brings. These steps are for a good reason ... they protect her from instantaneously being transported back in time to a specific moment with her beloved boyfriend Max (David Corenswet, ""Hollywood"" mini-series, and he's the new Superman). For Harriet, these aren't merely flashbacks or memories - she is physically transported back in time when she hears a song. Rather than HOT TUB TIME MACHINE, she's living ""Hi-Fidelity Time Machine"". Her trip only lasts as long as the song is playing, yet she has no control. Once back in real time, she is viewed as having had a seizure. It's frightening stuff for her. However, instead of being concerned about her health, she is intent on finding the song that takes her back to the moment she can change the past and prevent the accident that cost Max his life.

Harriet's BFF Morris (Austin Crute, BOOKSMART, 2019), a local DJ, has been very supportive of her grief, but it's been two years since Max died, and Morris wants his friend to move on with life. Hope springs when Harriet meets David (a terrific Justin Min, ""Beef"") at a grief counseling group event. The two are understandable tentative around each other, yet it's obvious David is a good dude with the necessary patience to allow her to work through her grief. Harriet's case of d√©j√† vu with David comes full circle, and adds a nice touch to the delicate situation they find themselves locked in.

Wanting to change the past is something we have all thought of at one time or another, yet the physical transformations that Harriet experiences feel like something beyond science fiction, and bordering on psychological torture. Filmmaker Benson has delivered a film that is simultaneously relatable, while also landing pretty far outside the box. There is a throwback feeling here, despite the characters feeling very much of this day. As you might expect, the soundtrack is quite varied with some deep cuts ... with Roxy Music being a key. Although there may not be any big surprises in how the story unfolds, the characters are so relatable, and it's so well acted, that we find ourselves pulling for each of them to have a happy ending.

Despite the promising premise, the execution fell short, leaving many questions unanswered and many scenes feeling disjointed.

What kept me engaged were the performances of the actors, who delivered their roles with commendable skill and depth. Their talent was the saving grace of the film, bringing some life to an otherwise muddled storyline. It's a pity that their efforts were overshadowed by the film's structural issues.

In the end, while the film had its moments, it didn't live up to the high expectations I had. I can only give it a 5 out of 10, primarily because of the actors' performances, whom I truly admire.

Borderlands,"Kind of a letdown, but not really.","I just watched the movie. Might need to rewatch it again for details, though I really dont need to.

There are a lot of bad reviews about the movie, but remember the game needs hours and hours of grinding, you need to compress that in an 1:30:00 long movie. Its kinda hard.

There are a lot of hits and a couple of misses, though the misses are rough and do diminish the enjoy ability of the movie, at least for the fans of the games.

If they correct them for the sequel, it would turn out better, but it wont be a sequel, so, there is that.

For the ones that are fans and need a quick review.

Hits.

World building. It does look like pandora.

Tiny Tina. Ariana Greenblatt nailed it. Its a shame that she gets little screen time and no scenes for herself.

Krieg. Though I didnt played him in the dlc. He does feel like a character of Pandora.

CL4P-TP AKA Claptrap. Wacky and clumsy, with the sense of humor we love. It is Claptrap, its even used as in the game. Highlight of the movie.

Action scenes. Though not all of them are great, they do somewhat resemble something you would see and expect from the adaptation of the game though a bit subpar. Passable.

Humor. The humor was, in general, in similar fashion with the game. They nailed most of the times. It just that it was PG-13 instead of R. It diminishes a bit, but still fine.

Meh. Tannis. She looks the part, but there was no real chance to explore the character.

Misses. Mad Moxxi. Same as Tannis, there was no real time to explore the character. But it was a miscast anyways. Only lasted a few minutes though.

Roland. For me, Roland is the least interesting character personality wise in the game. It was translated to the movie in the same fashion. Uninteresting. And certainly Kevin Heart doesnt do much either.

General Knoxx. This one sucks. General Knoxx is an imposing dude with a giant armor, and though we dont see him a lot in the game, you know its the real deal.

Here, they genderswapped him, and the female character was uninteresting, unimposing, and lame. I dont know why they need another ""empowered"" female, they already had the main character. They messed up big time. Genderswapping him was a low blow, making it lame it was the worst. It really sucked.

Lilith. Both a hit and miss. It is supposed to be a comedy, but they turned lilith into a bitter annoying character.

She just kill the mood in the earlier scenes.

Halfway of the movie, once the action begins, it gets better, decent even, but the damage was already done.

Script. While the movie plot was nothing amazing (it is a popcorn movie after all), it had some dumb dialog that did not emulated the game. It happens mostly during the first half, but again, the damage was already done.

Overall, I dont think it was the actors fault for the misses of the movie (Though a case can be done for Cate Blanchett, who delivered the lines in a bitter way, maybe it was supposed to be in a dark comedy style, dont know, but that is not Lilith for the first half of the movie)

It was a good attempt. I genuinely laughed in the few moments we had tina, claptrap and krieg working together, but it is not enough.

It almost worked, it was the writting. The writters that did not developed the characters always want to add something of their own in the adaptations. It almost always fails. Studios should hire the original writters. Stuff like this is why not everyone sided with the writters in the latest strike.

The movie felt constantly like something was missing. The plot was clich√©, the music was lame and kinda clich√© too. The action looked good, but felt empty. Large impactful blows, huge explosions, many gunfight, not one drop of blood.

I'd say this movie has just the right silly typical clich√© plot for a nice absurd splatterfest. It had none. It was lacking. It felt pointless. It is pointless.

It seemed like only Cate Blanchett and Jack Black even remotely looked anything about the characters they played. Everyone else would show the the slightest bit of actual representation and the immediately throw it in to the trash fire that is this movie.

And the mix matching of the story made no sense. Why stick to the game but only part of the time. And barely mentioning if at all the biggest of the 4 main companies was a weird choice.

Borderlands,They tried to do too much,"The Borderlands movie attempts to capture the chaotic spirit of the video game series but ultimately falls flat. With a disjointed plot that feels more like a collection of clich√©s than a cohesive story, it fails to engage both fans and newcomers alike.

Character development is sorely lacking; the iconic personalities from the game are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures. For instance, Roland, portrayed by Kevin Hart, could have been played by anyone in the world and produced the same effect. However, the worst cast selection for the movie is Jamie Lee, as Tannis. She has delivered another flat performance while managing to overact at the same time.

Kreig is there as well (well adapted, but... he's just there, for reasons).

As far as the dialogue goes, it often feels forced and cringe-worthy.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes are vibrant and capture the game's aesthetic, many others feel cheap and poorly executed, giving it a low-budget vibe. The action sequences, meant to be exhilarating, come off as repetitive and uninspired.

Borderlands,They don't care about Borderlands.,"The number one reason that I know that the creators of this movie were only in it for the money and not for the love of franchise is because they chose to rate this movie PG-13. The comedy from the video games require this film to be rated R. They attempted to have the same style of humor as they did in the video games but it was just not there. It was very underwhelming & most of the jokes fell completely flat. They chose to write this movie PG-13 so it would appeal to a broader audience and in return give them more money.

The action was subpar, and we didn't see the blood and gore that we see in the video games. The action scenes weren't there and it made me cringe every time I predicted something. The predictability, and the use of old tropes had me wincing in pain in the movie theatre. I excepted so much more.

Bobby Lee totally embarrassed himself and will probably never work in Hollywood again and Kevin Hart obviously has no shame. He might as well do the next Saved By The Bell remake.

Jamie Lee Curtis tries to be an action hero again, but she's like 75. You're not fooling anyone, except your agent. I guarantee she smells like preparation-h and vagisil. Please stop trying to act like you are 30 again, you're embarrassing yourself.

Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End,Apocalypse Z: A Right Bore in the Midst of a Deadly Virus**,"""Apocalypse Z"" sets its scene in a world ravaged by a deadly virus that turns people into zombie-like creatures. The premise is decent enough: a survivor has to navigate the ruined world to find grub, all while dodging the infected. Sadly, the execution of this film leaves a lot to be desired. Pretty much the first half of the film drags on something awful and is proper dull. Take for instance the scenes where the main character is rooting around in houses for supplies; it should be a tense affair, but instead it's just monotonous and there's no suspense whatsoever. That bit could have been skipped entirely, as it serves no purpose and doesn't affect the premise or the plot in the slightest. There's no real threat or tension built up, so those scenes feel pointless and just make the film longer for no good reason.

Aside from the snail's pace of the plot, the main character is a bit of a nincompoop. The daft decisions they keep making, especially this urge to help everyone in a seriously dodgy situation, just don't ring true and are downright frustrating. Instead of feeling for them, you're more likely to be tutting and rolling your eyes at their antics.

Visually, the film is nothing to write home about either. Compared to other films about outbreaks or deadly viruses that turn people nasty, like ""Train to Busan"" or ""World War Z,"" which manage to deliver cracking action sequences and impressive visuals, ""Apocalypse Z"" is miles behind. Some scenes are even shot in the dark or at dusk, which just makes it hard to see what's going on. Instead of adding to the atmosphere, it feels more like they're trying to hide the film's shortcomings.

The casting of the actors and actresses, who are, in my opinion, not particularly easy on the eye (though that's subjective, mind you), adds to the gloomy and uninspiring feel of the film. The lack of anyone who provides a bit of eye candy might be a downer for some viewers.

All in all, ""Apocalypse Z"" is a thoroughly disappointing film. The plodding and tedious plot, the irritating main character, the uninspiring visuals, and the poorly lit scenes all add up to a right old mess. With a heavy heart, I can only give this film **1 out of 10 stars**. It's hard to recommend this to anyone, even fans of post-apocalyptic or outbreak films.

Survive,Ignore the negative reviews,"""The characters make dumb decisions"" Yeah? YOU do as well under THEM circumstances, *insert descriptive colorful insult*.

This is NOT an American Movie, but a French Film and the 'decisions' are actually pretty good considering it's an intellectual anc cultured family who face a weird armageddon scenario.

At about an hour in, there is an opportunity which could be taken, and I've not seen and American film have such characters take full advantage like this family does.

The science - as I alluded to - is hokey as hell, but we're not here for that.

Venom: The Last Dance,Made me tear up,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.

Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.

This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.

Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.

Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.

Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",7.0,278,127,love,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7007110118865967}",EMPTY
Venom: The Last Dance,1/10 - An Abomination That Should Have Never Seen the Light of Day,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.

The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.

The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.

Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.

The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.

They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.

It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.

The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.

At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.

Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.

Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.

Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?

It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.

Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.

If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",,268,233,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8713839054107666}",Negative

Venom: The Last Dance,Inadequately Explorative,"Though not as intriguing as its predecessors, ""Venom: The Last Dance"" managed to provide entertainment and humour in good-enough doses.

Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom (voiceover) continued to impress. He landed a handful of good plot-worthy touchdowns as this iconic character.

In ""The Last Dance"", our conflicted duo had the unenviable task of facing up to a deadly alien terror. Venom's past returned to haunt him in the form of a being (Knull) who was imprisoned back on his original home planet.

Eddie was again at his wit's end, more so than before, as he tried to keep his own home and Venom safe from the perils coming for them.

I liked what Chiwetel Ejiofor (as General Strickland), Rhys Ifans (as Martin), Juno Temple (as Dr. Teddy Paine), Stephen Graham (as Detective Mulligan), and Andy Serkis (as Knull) brought to this tale.

The plot also tapped generously into the ""Dark Forest theory"", which speculates that any space-faring civilization (like highly advanced aliens or extraterrestrials) would see other intelligent life (like humankind) as a threat to their own future.

To ensure nothing bad comes out of any potential contact, such aliens would destroy us if we ever made our presence known to them.

Venom's native planet - Klyntar (""cage"") - contained one such hostile alien beast-race called the Xenophages (outstanding creature design btw) who specialised in Symbiote hunting.

Before long, they threatened the future of life on Earth after successfully tracking Venom - and other symbiotes like him - to the Blue Planet following orders from their humanoid overlord Knull, who also happened to be the creator of the Symbiotes.

After having betrayed him (for valid reasons), the Symbiotes had escaped into hiding but their maker had at last found them and wanted to steal the Codex, which manifested inside Venom that one time he brought Eddie back to life following a fatal incident.

Avoiding taking on his true full form, Venom and Eddie went about doing what the duo do best. ""The Last Dance"" thus proved to be a dark dive into the Symbiotes' darker past, making it an interesting addition to the ""Venom"" universe.

I especially admired what they did with the Symbiote co-op scenes (in the Area-51 subterranean lab). It held great promise for the future of this franchise, particularly a story-branch featuring Dr. Teddy Paine and her newfound lightning-powered Symbiote.

The surprisingly emotional sequences that appeared later in the movie between Eddie and Venom were amazing as well.

Regardless of a few contrived sequences (and some out-of-character risks), ""Venom: The Last Dance"" was an okay sequel, largely thanks to how inadequately it covered the anti-hero's origins in what was, quite literally, his final film.

Sadly, this is indeed the last ""Venom"" movie in the franchise, so any dreams of redemption have probably been dashed. I didn't like how little effort they put into exploring some of the plot-arcs without delving deeper - enormous disappointment, there.

Based on the post-credit scene and what Knull said - ""...and you will watch!"" - I have a feeling the Symbiote maker may remake Venom, if only to have him witness the destruction of his adoptive planet, Earth. But I'm not going to harbour any hope.

Venom: The Last Dance,What was this movie even for?!,"I had to reread my reviews for the previous Venom movies I remembered nothing from. I liked the first, I hated the second because it had no story and no chemistry. This one has some chemistry between Brock and the symbiont, but man all the rest is a jumbled mess that makes no sense at the best of times. It is a complete waste of time.

First of all, remember that scene at the end of Venom 2 when he was transported into the Spiderman universe? Well, he gets back immediately and says he hates multiverses. Yeah, we hear you, buddy. And with the release of Last Dance, Sony announced the cancelling of all these pointless Spiderman spin-off flops. So with a movie that probably they knew would do nothing at the box office, maybe they could have taken some liberty. Like free Knull and destroy the universe. That would teach them copyright lawyers, right? No. Instead they did... what they usually do. Absolutely nothing.

The problem with the film is that it's not a film. It's a collection of short scenes that don't belong together and of actors that have no business being there. You switch from a comedic bar scene to Venom killing some Mexican dog breeders, from comedic hanging off an airplane and joking about Tom Cruise to Brock personally having to kill someone in self defense, feel bad about it and even express his trauma in like two sentences, from universe ending monsters following a McGuffin to dancing in a hotel in Vegas and bringing said monster to them. It goes on like this. A random hippie family. A scientist with a backstory that ultimately leads nowhere (and played by Juno Temple who looks awful! What the hell happened to her?), another scientist that pretty much fills the whole role, Mulligan is alive (heh, Mulligan, I wonder if that was a joke they knew they were going to make happen), the God of the Void is called Null?! Well, Knull, but whatever, the K is silent.

Even the CGI battles were ridiculous. Multiple symbionts stabbing monsters that can regenerate from being shredded in jet engines, said monsters hitting symbionts when they can emit specific sound to neutralize them, soldiers shooting at both knowing full well it was pointless. Why is Knull a humanoid with white hair? Why does he sound like Gollum? What were they thinking?!

Who the hell was this movie made for? Other than a tiny part rightfully ending the arc of Venom, the rest were like random stuff someone got out from the closet and plastered on.

The film has a good cast, obviously Tom Hardy is great as Venom, Chiwetel Ejiofor is very underrated in my opinion, Stephen Graham who is always good, and the gorgeous, and talented Juno Temple who I think is also criminally underrated, and Rhys Ifans who I'm not actually sure if I like him hmmm.

Venom: The Last Dance,I can't lie this is probably the worst one. Very mid.,"Good bits- ok so I enjoyed the fights, and some of the comedy was funny. And the gambling scene was hilarious. I guess it was sad when Venom sacrificed himself for eddy and a good scene at the end where he reminisces on the good times he had with his symbiote. However I hadn't seen venom 1 or 2 for a long time so didn't feel anything from it.

Bad bits - extremely messy plot with characters that didn't need to exist and served no purpose other than to pad the run time. Why is there a woman who can conduct lightning? I don't know, and I don't think the director knew. Why didn't knull design his symbiote hunters to see symbiotes even when not fully out because he definitely should know about that? I don't know.

Speaking of knull, the ""villain"" of this movie, why does he only get 5 minutes of screen time and all of it is in exposition that is repeated like three times? Why is venom dancing with Mrs Chen despite knowing that it will put himself, Mrs Chen and other innocents in danger? Uhh.. because it was funny?

Venom: The Last Dance,Just as good as the others! Definitely worth a watch!,"Watched this in theaters yesterday and I'm actually pretty surprised with how fun this one was!

Had all the same good types of things that the first 2 did, along with a bit more alien action (if you liked at least one of the first 2, you'll definitely like this one) the CGI was peak imo and the story added some cool concepts from the comics. (If you didn't like LTBC, you may honestly like this one, it fixed the issue of the villain being too watered down to some people)

I'll admit it felt a bit rushed and slow at times compared to the others and needed a longer runtime, but that didn't take away from the whole movie for me, as I basically just wanted more of a good thing.

Another thing I was surprised about was this one compared to the others was actually a bit closer to R rated violence than expected and had more horror like vibes at times, which was awesome! (Still didn't reach an R rating tho) The Xenophages were one of the coolest aliens added to this franchise, very impressed by those!

Loved Knull as well, they absolutely did him justice, I'm glad they didn't tone him down.

The only major gripe I'd have was some of the side characters screentime was unnecessarily long and took away from Eddie and Venom, still overall it just needed to be longer to get everyone in there.

Again, same as the first 2, forget the critics reviews and bad press and decide for yourself! It really is a good entry into the trilogy, there's always gonna be hate for these I swear, no matter what the normal viewer thinks smh

This one was honestly one of the more emotional marvel movies for me, despite it having the same hilarious comedy that it usually has, it was a good balance.

Spoilers ahead:

I'm extremely conflicted at the ending, very bittersweet, almost upsetting but that goes to show how good the character development was, it was still very good regardless, I just love the character too much to let it go.

Let's hope this isn't truly the end for Eddie and Venom, if they aren't in Spider-Man 4 I may not be too interested in seeing it tbh, it's long overdue and feels like we're being cheated out of one of the best crossover movies that can happen.",10.0,3,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.5680477619171143}",EMPTY

2. Venom: The Last Dance

Yup, the first part for me the most weak one.

In third part we already have some consequences from other films and Eddie getting chased by police and special agents. It's interesting how we start from the post credit scene of Spider Man: No Way Home, then he teleports back to his reality because of Knull and was still in the same bar. There he left some simbiote (on his reality), but we also seen that he left some simbiote in main universe as well thank to NWH post credit scene. Movie have some good jokes, a bit of cringe jokes as well. We also have nice action. Sony presented us so many new simbiotes and unfortunately almost every of them dies. But we got Agony alive at least. The finale, where Venom dies is a tragic moment. It's very sad, some people in my cinema were literally sobbing. To be honest I also dropped some tears. But I only started crying for real where starts ""edit"" of some memories with Venom. That was really sad for me personally. I went on every Venom movie in theatres, but rewatched both parts before Venom 3. So I got really upset about him dying when I remembered some good memories that I shared with this films.

Venom: The Last Dance,Venom: The Last Dance review,"As the larger Marvel and DC cinematic universes go through massive reshuffling, an old, but familiar and comfortable character is having his cinematic swan song. Aptly titled Venom: The Last Dance, the third entry in what is now a trilogy makes some very bold and bizarre choices. And in a strange way, winds up being simultaneously the best and worst Venom movie...

The film picks up with Eddie and Venom being warped back into their own universe after an admittedly wasted cameo that went nowhere in the Multiverse Saga. Following the events of Let There Be Carnage, the symbiotic duo are hiding out in Mexico. But everyone else seems hellbent on finding them, including other extra-terrestrials, and the US Government.

We randomly get the introduction of Knull, who is teased as a new big bad, but who knows if that's going anywhere? There's also an entire subplot about Area 51 being decommissioned and this entire other movie that plays out like a sci-fi thriller about aliens. Which is strange considering we're not three movies in and still having the ""are aliens real"" debate.

V 1
His whole intro feels very much like the opening scene of the first Avengers, and not in a good way...

Much like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 that came before, Venom: The Last Dance feels like way too many movies crammed into one. Any one of these subplots could easily be an entire movie, and everything just feels very rushed. As a result Eddie/Venom, despite being the main characters, feel more like spectators as everyone else drives the plot.

The entire Area 51 alien subplot feels like it's from another movie. It takes itself way too seriously, and honestly would have made more sense if that had been the first Venom movie. You have people like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Juno Temple giving solid performances that don't mesh tonally at all with anything else.

V 3
Temple kind of feels like the protagonist in her own movie, and no one seems to notice that Ejiofor's general character looks oddly close to Mordo from Doctor Strange...

That being said, Tom Hardy is on his A-game here and I'd honestly just watch an entire movie of Eddie and Venom going about an ordinary day and getting into hijinks. This one also goes all out with Venom bonding with other animals and truly exploring his potential as a symbiote.

When the movie is just being a fun buddy comedy with these two, it's more entertaining, even if there's not really a point to it. Which brings us the ultimate dilemma, do we judge this movie by its more fun moments that have no purpose, or judge it by the more serious plot that has major flaws?

Ultimately, it's clear that they knew they needed to wrap up this character's story, and they threw this together using whatever random ingredients of old scripts they had lying around. Fans wanted to see this Venom take on Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and that never happened. So this movie was the next best thing they could do.",,0,3,anger,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.6290432214736938}",EMPTY

Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate,A mega waste of time and one that insults those who loved the film,"Megamind vs The Doom Syndicate could've honestly been a good sequel to an excellent movie. With the ideas possible for what to do after how the first film went, there was a great potential for it to have more to the franchise. But if this is the direction the sequels are going after a long time for waiting, then it's making me regret ever want to see this film get a sequel.

Taking place after the movie, Megamind is settling into his new role as a hero and not the villain. His new heroic life takes an unexpected turn when his former team of evil villains come to Earth with the intentions of destroying it. It now falls to Megamind to create a new team to beat his former one and save the Earth before it's too late.

Now, the premise doesn't sound too bad on paper. In fact, I was willing to give it a shot and see what they could do with it. Oh, how wrong I was with how they completely dropped the ball.

The animation in general is horrible. I know this is on a budget for a streaming service, but was this the best they could do? Characters move either very awkwardly, stiff, and in some cases their limbs look broken or out of place. Compare it to the movie that came out over a decade ago and the animation there still looks crisp and clean. This looks like an amateur's first project done.

The acting is awful. None of the cast from the first film are back and they're really missed here. Keith Ferguson reprises his role as Megamind from the video games, but he sounds so disinterested most of the time. The rest of the cast is certainly no better at all and don't seem like they want to be there. The only one who seems to be trying the best is Josh Brenon as Minion, or Ol' Chum now. He seems to at least be putting in effort.

The characters are worse. Virtually none of the charactrers, old and new, are likable anymore. The fact Minion had to change his name because of some cease and desist order is stupid. Seriously? Who orders someone to change their name because of some brand name? The kid sidekick, Keiko, is arguably the worst and downright annoying. You know the old stereotype of a kid sidekick? Keiko is all of those old traits in her and has no reason to be here.

The villains are equally as lame. Their designs are okay at best, but compared to the previous villain of the movie, Hal/Titan, they fall very short. They're either being obnoxious, stupid, or both. It's no wonder Megamind wanted to get away from them with how irritating they are.

The writing is abysmal to say the least. The charm of Megamind had some solid comedy, but knew when to be serious or combine the two. Here, many of the jokes are horribly done or so painfully obvious you can see it coming as soon as they start setting up the joke. The dialogue is somehow worst. Characters say stuff that sounds either insufferable or makes you wonder who talks like that. Even in moments that are supposed to be uplifting or emotional, the dialogue is horrible and the immersion is ruined with either dumb jokes or saying something that doesn't fit for the scene.

I can't recommend this movie at all to anyone. This isn't meant for anyone who loved Megamind and it certainly shouldn't be used to introduce someone to the franchise itself. It's an absolute mess from beginning to end and feels like an insult to people who waited 14 years for a followup. What should've been a triumph and great movie ends up being one of the worst sequels to a classic ever.

Madame Web,Web of missed opportunities,"Madame Web promised an intriguing dive into the Spider-Man universe, but unfortunately, it ends up tangled in its own web of disappointments. While the film manages to offer a bit of entertainment, especially for die-hard fans of the superhero genre, it falters significantly in many areas that are crucial to its success.

On the plus side, the film does have moments of entertainment value. Some action sequences are mildly engaging, and there's a certain appeal in seeing a new corner of the Spider-Man universe explored. However, these positives are overshadowed by a host of issues that make Madame Web more of a letdown than a triumph.

One of the major drawbacks is the film's lackluster cinematography and visual presentation. The overall look of the movie feels flat and uninspired, failing to deliver the dynamic and visually engaging experience one would expect from a superhero film. The CGI is particularly poor, with many sequences appearing amateurish and detracting from the immersion rather than enhancing it. The editing also leaves much to be desired, with choppy transitions and pacing issues that make the narrative feel disjointed and tedious.

The characters in Madame Web are sorely underdeveloped. The titular Madame Web, portrayed by Dakota Johnson, lacks the significant powers or compelling backstory that would make her character stand out. Instead, we get a vague and underwhelming portrayal that doesn't justify her importance in the Spider-Man universe. The supporting cast fares no better, with characters that are either bland or forgettable, contributing little to the overall story or emotional depth.

The villain, played by a capable actor, is disappointingly bland. The motivations and backstory are underexplored, resulting in a character that feels more like a checklist of villainous traits rather than a fully fleshed-out antagonist. This lack of depth further weakens the film's impact, as the conflict feels forced and unconvincing.

Additionally, it's clear that Madame Web is more focused on setting up future sequels than on delivering a satisfying standalone story. The film spends an inordinate amount of time laying the groundwork for potential future installments, which is frustrating given that a sequel now seems unlikely, this focus feels like a misstep, leaving the film feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.

In the end, Madame Web fails to live up to its potential. While it has moments of entertainment, it's marred by poor cinematography, underdeveloped characters, a lackluster villain, and subpar visual effects. The film's attempt to build towards a sequel only serves to highlight its shortcomings rather than elevate it. For those looking for a compelling addition to the Spider-Man universe, this film might leave you more tangled in disappointment than in excitement.",5.0,3,1,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8692301511764526}",Negative

Madame Web,Cool spidey spin off,"I don't entirely understand the negative views. This film is not garbage.

Madame Web,Just went with the first draft?,"Someone wrote the main plot and a few bullet point ideas on a napkin the night before filming began and they just went with that, it seems.

Ben Parker was way too old to not yet be with May, they're supposed to be an old couple who have been together forever by the time Peter gets his abilities but with this timeline they'd hardly have 10 years of marriage behind them.

A truck smashes into an ambulance seemingly at a crossroads but as the camera pans out it was headed to a dead end at the edge of a dock so why was the truck going so fast 100 yards from a dead end?!

Barely 2 minutes after they escape the subway it's already on the radio about police being attacked by them.

After only 4 hours or so of being ""missing"" a truck driver has a copy of the Daily Bugle with the girls ""abduction"" as front page news... ON THE SAME DAY THE INCIDENT OCCURS! No paper is that fast to report, print and distribute in half a day.

Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and innovative, because it wasn't similar to any other marvel movie. The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable (especially, the three girls). The casting was great and their performances were nice (especially, Sydney's, Celeste's and Isabela's acting). In my opinion, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and there were many epic fight sequences (for example, the subway chase scene, the dinner fight scene and the taxi chase sequence). Moreover, the CGI effects and the score of the movie were both incredible, however the cinematography wasn't very well executed sometimes. The opening scene was predictable and it wasn't really promising. Gladly, the 2nd act was fast-paced and adventurous. The final fight scene was marvelous, breathtaking and it was definitely the best part of the movie. I have to admit, it wasn't as bas as most reviews said and it was definitely, an enjoyable film.

Madame Web,The movie is not as bad as critics describe it.,"I just saw Madame Web today and despite it being a drama movie instead of superheroes, it's not bad. It is a normal movie to watch one day at home or family who wants to try something different.

As a fan of Marvel, but especially of Spiderman, you forget that it is a superhero movie because of the plot of the movie. It is true that a man in a black suit dressed as Spiderman begins to chase 3 teenagers throughout the entire movie, but it is more of a plot of murderers than the whole thing.

Personally, I didn't like changing the entire plot and removing Spider-Man from the movie, because the plot required having someone powerful to be able to fight Ezequiel Sims. The powers aspect was too distant, and it is impossible for me to believe that someone with super strength, spider sense, regeneration, etc. Was defeated by a normal person who could only see the future.

Dakotan Johnson said in an interview that the script was completely changed after they signed the contract for the film, which is seen to be true due to the constant cuts in the film, the forced scenes without deep dialogues, the fillers of the girls for wanting to be teenagers and an Ezekiel plot for not wanting to make a plan to get revenge in the future.

One of the things that bothered me was changing Spider-Man's iconic phrase, but not only that, it was removing him from the map completely. I understand that Sony wants to give importance to secondary characters in the universe, but in reality we fans only want to see Spiderman and Spiderman Variants, nothing more. But ask them about all the projects that have the name Spiderman that are well received. So the question is, why make a movie fail by removing the star producer?

Madame Web,Definitely not the worst Marvel movie,"This is not Spider-Man. This is not Avengers. This is Madame Web. And it was an enjoyable film of the Marvel Universe.

The worst areas of this movie is some of the early CG, but it's made up by Dakota Johnson's portrayal and her onscreen chemistry with Adam Scott, as well as the young teenagers. This is very much an origin story of Cassie Webb confronting her own past to understand what she's destined for and with Madame Web it's filled with mystery and time. Visuals from Madame Web's perspective were twisting and confusing with intention, which I felt was appropriate and engaging.

It's a fun movie, and while it may not revolutionize the film industry or call upon the likes of Steve Rogers or Thor for another explosive epic like the Infinity Saga, it does set up for some important arcs in the future. For an origin story that I didn't expect or even think was necessary, I truly had fun watching this one, and I'd recommend it to people that want to just shut off and watch something, and I'd watch it again.

Honestly, people calling this the worst Marvel film, or for some the worst film in history are overdramatizing their own, or possibly someone else's criticism that they are shadowing. If you read the bad reviews and believe them, chances are you're already in a negative mindset going in yourself.

The entire movie seemed so one dimensional. The entire part where she went to 'learn' about her beginnings was so quick and so uneventful. Dakota continued to fall flat and didn't look as if she could fake the emotions she was supposed to be having.

Madame Web,"Flat, Boring and missed Comedic moments","Wanted to like this film but at the end, it felt really boring and flat. Then I read about the extensive rewrites, so no wonder the film is a dud.

It opens with the back story of Madame Web's mother who is pregnant in the Amazon, how she dies and was bitten by a rare spider with healing and supernatural powers. Then we move forward to a grown up Cassandra Webb in 2003 who is an EMT in NYC. As the story evolves, we learn about her EMT partner (Ben Parker) whose family will eventually produce the future Spiderman (Peter Parker). The original script had Cassandra involved in saving the unborn Spiderman from the nemesis who killed her mother. These rewrites explain why they built up the cast in the firehouse in the beginning but don't use them throughout the film.

Then 3 teens are added who need Cassandra's protection as her clairvoyant powers emerge and the talent of these young actors are wasted. The script is schizophrenic. It morphs from a superhero film to a horror flick during future flashes.

Instead of the wit & humor found in beloved superhero films, the writers give us a passenger who keeps asking Cassandra if he's on the right train. So many missed opportunities. While the 3 teens have sassy personalities, they're mostly used as midriff eye candy in the film. And when Dakota Johnson tries to climb her closet wall like a spider, this could have resulted in a good comedic pratfall but was missed.

Future flashes are handled clumsily. In the writer's desperate attempt to introduce futuristic tech, they have the nemesis acquire new facial recognition & aging software, access to city wide CCTV, control traffic lights and advance cell and Bluetooth technology.

Despite the writers' attempt to cobble together a script, there should have been more smart action and dialogue like in the ambulance scene towards the end where they throw off the nemesis using a charged defibrillator.",3.0,2,5,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8999975323677063}",Negative

I'll just say that this is one of the worst script from a movie I had watched. The Peru scenes are probably one of the dumbest (and funniest) backstory/explanation in history. It expects you to be shocked but the way they presented it is so questionable it hurts. The 'oracle' plot of the film is so on the nose, it really was laughably absurd at times that the only other person from my showing had to leave.

Dakota Johnson cannot carry face acting that this ""superhero"" role requires. She just is so plain and uninspired.

Her line reading is so dour and straight, it reads so awfully and funnily (regardless of seriousness) on-screen. She tries to act normally that her scene does not translate the 'hero' scenario.

The movie probably would have been a lot better had they picked different writers instead of going with the Morbius team. Due to their choice, the end result was a story which was too scattered and not coherent enough. Another criticism would be with the monotonous delivery by the lead actress Dakota Johnson.

Madame Web,Oh boy was this a real turkey for 2024,"Madame Webb is a 2024 Supernatural Thriller starring Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades Of Grey),Sydney Sweeney(Anyone But You),Isabela Merced(Dora And The Lost City Of Gold),Celeste O Connor,Tahar Rahim,Emma Roberts,Adam Scott and Kerry Bisch√®.

The story starts off in 1976 and we see a young pregnant woman named Constance(Bisch√®) who is fascinated with this unique spider at the rainforest. However a deranged man(Rahim) who was accompanying her,kills her and she ends up being resurrected by a spider like man who delivers the baby girl.

Fast forward to 2003 and Cassandra Webb(Johnson) is now a paramedic working with Ben Parker(Scott). However she starts to develop telepathic powers where she can sense when danger is ahead.

Meanwhile the man that killed her mother in 1976 is out for revenge and is dragging 3 young girls into it(Merced,Sweeney and O'Connor)where Cassie befriends. Will they stop the bad guy once and for all?.

Overall it was a very silly movie that made zero sense as the film is connected to Spiderman/Peter Parker and the filmmakers mention that Peter was born in late 2003 yet the OG Peter was born in 1985?. The acting was average,the story was ridiculously bad and the special effects was up there with Spiderman 3. As for the Villian he was just terrible.

This movie is just one cliche after another. None of the dialogue throughout the movie is smooth, it's all full of awkwardness and mostly cringeworthy statements.

Madame Web,"Leaping spider-fetus! This is not a drill, i repeat, leaping spider fetus.","That somewhat known by some people character, that is known for being an old lady, was turned into a young woman. Who is younger than me. And this film doesn't take place in the the 60s or even in the 80s. This takes place in the beginning of 2004. By 2024 she will still be younger than Madonna and Madonna doesn't look like the old lady Madame Web. Meanwhile Ezekiel Sims was turned into some dork who already wears a knock-off spider-man costume, and he is a bad guy. He has no use as a bad guy, since his involvement is always related to the totemic powers. Without him they won't do totemic powers, and without them he is a bad villain. Is this like the only name they had a license to? Were they forbidden from creating new original villains?

And well this film is not good at all. I didn't hate it, and it wasn't overly boring. But bad craft is bad craft. Most of the lines from the protagonist are like the first takes. They are read with no emotion or relation to the scene, often with mistakes. And the writing is pettily dumb. It's another predestination story where prequel has to project future developments into the past. Madame is not a character, she can't have her own life, no she is an accessory of Peter Parker. She is a tchotchke on Peter's table. She is not a random person from the street with her own story, this version knows Parkers and looks at spider-fetus.

So when they got into a car, Madame threw away a cell-phone cos of tracking. But from the diegesis tracking is good, they think that the cops can track them, which would benefit them. They have no knowledge that some loner can magically track the whole world with magic AI image generation that can read his dreams through a dreamcatcher. And she could allow the girl to drop an SMS or even make a call saying she is alright, and then throw away the phone. Also, it's 2004, why she threw away one phone and not four? Is this written by alphers who can't imagine that in 2004 everyone had a phone even in the third world crapholes where they were sending chiptune ringtones to each other over IR-ports after they purchased them from newspaper ads? And middle class could afford coloured phones with polyphony.

When she went to a diner by a car it was twice slower than when she walked, but she walked there in minutes, while the dorks spent hours on that hike. And the film pretends that Toxic is this new hot thing. But by that time she was already old news, and that was her swan song, a blip by an old lady before a total obscurity. Everyone remembered her from their own youth, it was not a new unknown artist.

Madame just screws off for two weeks, into another country, and nothing happens at all. Wow, what a writing.

In the scene near the cave-pond there's probably the worst ADR i ever saw in cinema. Yes, even worse than all the memes and the 80s films and animation i saw in the last 5 years. It's a different take with a different mic, with a different sound picture, with no attempts at mixing it together with the rest, and this is a high-budget high-profile AAA garbage release, no an indie creation or some B-film.

When Parker screams for attention, so they can film her giving birth, why the absolute hell did they all go into the car? What use do they have there? They could remain home and clean it up. They are parasitising on a good family, could at least clean it up. Nut instead they all rushed into cramped car to take space.

And then one of them sees a camera, and looks out posing for the photographs.

Then Ezekiel saw that the car gonna miss him, so he jumped up to make sure he will get hit by a car. And that's where they stopped drawing her giving birth to leaping spider fetus and entirely forgot about that, leaving her stranded in a carp pile.

Madame Web,Howard Hawks would be proud; a perfect satire; a future cult-classic,"This has been the greatest cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. I've seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in 70mm at the Aero, Lawrence of Arabia Roadshow Edition in 70mm, Hateful Eight, Oppenheimer, all of these cinematic masterpieces in 70mm, but none of them impacted me on an emotional level like Madame Web has. Everything in this movie is 100% intentional and the fact that people don't realize that astounds me. In this review I hope to share my experience for those to understand why this is a 10/10 satirical reflection on the state of superhero movies today, and how/why this made it an actual masterpiece better than Barbie.

Firstly, I saw it at the AMC, and I was thrilled the complete, full version of Nicole Kidman's introduction played. I always clap out loud. And as I made up 1/3 of the entire audience, I was able to clap and hoot as loud as I wanted. Second, I'm 99% positive the protectionist receive a note from Sony to mess up the projector, giving it a Grindhouse feel. The whites were ever so slightly red (you can see this during the MPAA green screen whim the trailers play) AND the projector was a little shaky! This added to the effect that I was watching something on film and added a B movie effect Tarantino fans will love. There is no way this is accidental given everything in this film.

I think Sony's greatest takeaway from Morbius was how popular the movie became because it was bad. So their idea: make something so bad it's good. This is 100% intentional and they succeeded in parodying themselves.

1. It takes itself seriously but is aware that it is taking itself seriously. All of these superhero movies today are too darn serious. These are spider women! This satire is set up immediately with the dialogue being on the nose, the acting purposefully being both bland and over the top but ""subtle,"" and the insane TikTok-ification of the camera. There is no consistency anywhere. The fake zooms in the beginning of the movie are clear evidence that it was on purpose because that's what is silly. The director is completely aware of this and does a fantastic job.

2. It takes place in 2003! Daredevil was released that year, Catwoman was being filmed, and Spider-Man 2 hadn't even been released yet. Putting it in this year with this style is meant to evoke the atmosphere of those movies. They have a level of cheese to them that we can enjoy today.

3. The antagonist: he is literally just a dude who is afraid women are going to kill him. They don't pose any actual threat. He gets up and starts fighting them because he is afraid. This is a reflection of the current socio-political climate today, especially in regards to resistance to female superheroes. YES, WE ALL KNOW ""it's not the women, it's bad writing."" To prove that point, there are no derogatory comments toward men in this entire movie. It follows the same formula as so many other superhero movies where they don't become the Titular Hero until the very end of the movie. While many people wanted to see a movie about Madam Web, this is a template origin story. It's not trying to be better than male superhero movies. It's doing the exact same thing, and that's the point. The conversation can now shift to the matter of: quality of writing. But the producers know what is selling and intend to milk it as long as possible. This film died a hero, like Dakota Johnson for 50 Shades, so her future can live a better life. Or, to quote Barbie, ""We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far they've come.""

4. The cast: Dakota Johnson, leading lady of 50 Shades of Grey, is THE WOMAN FOR THE JOB. She's done a notoriously bad movie before and she can do it again. She is a symbol of hope for the up and coming starlets of the movie: both in her character and IRL. Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced are all young starlets that are ""in"" with modern audiences. But how long will this last? Historically, and still today, the Hollywood system brings in young women-sorry, Celeste, I know your pronouns are they/them-exploiting their youth and good looks, only to not care about them after, oh, 25 (which is the cutoff age for Leonardo Dicpario's girlfriends). Yes, Sydney Sweeney is 26, but she plays a high schooler in Euphoria. Celeste O'Connor looks very young, and Isabela Merced was Dora! I'm glad the antagonist wasn't a woman trying to find the spider equivalent of the fountain of youth, because then the message is more on the nose and less enjoyable than the subtlety of this villain. The point I'm trying to make is: Dakota Johnson is a role model via character and as an actress for these young women. Their characters are completely empty and archetypes because that is what the industry has done to them in the past and present. The film ends with the quote, which is a VOICEOVER btw, ""The best part about the future? It hasn't happened yet.""
......^ this is driven further with the fact that Madame Web has the power of foresight. The original draft was some terminator thing. Yeah, stopping the future from happening?! Exactly! This movie perpetuates everything the previous superhero movies have done in order to end with you saying: I hope they stop making these bad movies. It is genius because it doesn't state this directly like Deadpool!

5. Characters are wardrobe: in addition to the diverse group of assigned-at-birth-females, the film further reflects society by having the up and coming starlets not be developed at all. They are literally just themselves. All of them are, in the future, spider women. By not developing them now, the positive point is: there is a Madame Web in all of us. But it's also an intentional reflection on how women are not developed in these movies: they are there for plot and appearance. Everyone accept for Johnson shows some sort of skin that is meant to please the (young) male viewers. They are quite aware of the power their exposed epidermis has on the male mind, as well as the 2003 representation of women. Celeste and Isabel bare mid-drift and Sydney is in an obvious Britney Spears school outfit, with stockings, baring her thighs. This is literal male gaze but it is done intentionally by a female director and her female/non-binary leading cast because it's a reflection. The theme of the movie is changing the future, so we have to acknowledge the past and present that will be changed. The male antagonist is afraid of this. And the corporate sponsorship product placement shows that democracy is indeed still alive and thriving because follow the money. If you want better movies, prove it with your wallets. I do want a Madame Web 2, but it's gotta be the movie we deserve, not the one we needed right now. Which, actually, this movie was BOTH. But you know what I mean. I don't think there will be a Madame Web 2, and I'm okay with that because it's the idea enough that builds the web of the future.

Also, Johnson's character being dismissive of a drawing of a kid despite her being a literal medical agent who protects and serves. It's bad and on purpose. So many of these characters have to ""overcome their internal flaw"" which is usually being a dick of some sort. It's the Christmas movie cliches of a parent working too much and not spending time with what matters: Family (as demonstrated in fast and furious 3-7). And Sydney Sweeney's character is randomly introduced by literally stating, ""Oh, and I'm his step sister by the way,"" then walks off. This is not an accident!

Oh, and let's not forget Emma freaking Roberts as the sister of Ben Parker! I can't say the mom of P**** Parker because ooooooo wHo CoUlD iT bE?!?! It's perfect. And her name being Mary, which is one letter shy of May, which made me incredibly confused of the timeline.

6. All of the little nuances in the film. The Optimus Prime 18 wheeler randomly in the background outside of the diner. ""What's Up"" by Four Non Blondes-which everyone in my generations knows as the He-Man ""HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA"" song is in the background, not the forefront. DREAMS BY THE CRANBERRIES AS THE END CREDITS! As any film student and lover of A24 films knows, that song was in the Wong Kar-Wai film Chungking Express. This is 100% intentional and not an accident. This is an 80 million dollar production. Everything on screen is intentional. Such as that CPR scene, which not only is an obvious foreshadowing added in hindsight, but... kinda a piece of fan service? It's a random scene for these women to put their hands and elbows close together in front of their chest while bending over. Yet they're all covered, thus indicating the stupidity of the camera's gaze and the scene as a whole. AND the whole twist on ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Genius. Again, another example that they are self aware and making fun of the entire genre as a whole. It's amazing.

7. The story: Howard Hawks would be proud. His philosophy is that the audience does not care about the plot so long as they are entertained; this movie, in doing all of the tropes which has come before it, and by not taking itself seriously through the direction taking itself seriously but only just so, proves his point. These movies are dumb and they know it. Theh have the classic Spider-Man voiceover! Completely unnecessary to the story and is there only to talk to the audience. You have not been tricked; you have been enlightened!

Madame Web is a cinematic masterpiece. It is a perfect image reflection on society today and the state of superhero movies. The fact that everyone is taking this movie seriously proves its own point. I will be buying this on 4K UHD when it comes out. I will also use whatever remaining AMC A List tickets I have left each week to go toward this masterpiece.

Madame Web,"""Veiling the Mind's Eye: Madame Web's Odyssey into the Unseen""","Embarking on Stardew Valley, I anticipated a straightforward journey of pastoral simplicity. Yet, beneath its unassuming surface, a narrative as convoluted and enigmatic as the darkest cinematic mysteries began to unfold. In Pelican Town, every planted seed and nurtured relationship spiraled into a narrative labyrinth, challenging my perceptions of reality, much like the complex webs of deception and illusion one might expect from Madame Web. However, where Madame Web tangled itself in its own ambitious plot, Stardew Valley masterfully wove a tale of profound depth and intrigue.

The daily rituals of this virtual Eden masked a deeper exploration of existence, where the ordinary transformed into the extraordinary. The townspeople, with their myriad secrets and desires, mirrored the complex characters of a psychological thriller, drawing me deeper into a story where truth flickered like a shadow, elusive and ever-changing. This journey through Stardew Valley, with its shifting realities and hidden depths, paralleled the twisted narratives found in tales of intrigue and mystery, where nothing is as it seems, and every revelation leads only to more questions.

Stardew Valley's serene fa√ßade belied a complex exploration of the human psyche, turning each in-game day into a step deeper into both the valley's and my own subconscious. Here, the boundaries between game and reality blurred, each discovery a piece of a puzzle that, when pieced together, revealed a picture far different from what I had initially perceived. This game became a reflection of the intricate dance between perception and reality, where Madame Web's attempt at a multifaceted narrative paled in comparison to the genuine depth and complexity Stardew Valley offered.

As I delved deeper into the heart of Pelican Town, I found a community of players whose shared experiences echoed the collective journey through our own psychological mazes. This communal narrative, rich with individual stories of discovery and revelation, underscored the profound impact of Stardew Valley. It became clear that this was not just a game, but a journey into the unknown, challenging us to question our understanding of reality, much like the protagonists of the most bewildering psychological thrillers.

In this digital idyll, Stardew Valley emerged not merely as a game but as an enigmatic masterpiece, ensnaring players in a narrative web as intricate and unpredictable as the plot twists of Madame Web, yet with the depth and coherence the film aspired to but ultimately failed to achieve. In the end, Stardew Valley revealed itself to be a mirror, reflecting the complexities of the mind and the elusive nature of truth, far outshining the tangled narrative of Madame Web with its serene yet profoundly deceptive storytelling.",10.0,1,8,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8138863444328308}",Positive

Subservience,Little Burden,"Megan Fox delivers her best performance to date-she absolutely nails it. For exactly 1 hour and 11 minutes, the movie was flawless, pulling me into its world completely. I was immersed, excited, hopeful even. And then, out of nowhere, it all went catastrophically wrong. It felt like being flushed down a toilet. The plot derailed spectacularly, becoming a full-blown train wreck. It's like the writer had an aneurysm, and someone else had to fumble through the rest of the script. It's as if you're watching two entirely different movies: one good, but unfinished, and one terrible, but missing the start.

Up until the moment Megan Fox delivers the line ""Little burden,"" I was sold. But as soon as those words left her mouth, I felt like the universe leaned in and whispered, ""It's a prank, bro!"" From there, it was like a cosmic slap in the face. The movie, which seemed so promising, morphed into exactly what everyone feared: a disaster. I could almost hear the universe laughing at me: ""Wait, you thought this might actually be good? How precious.""

I genuinely hope that, with the rise of AI, movies like this can be salvaged, restored to live up to their potential. I was eagerly awaiting how the android would outsmart its human constraints, maneuvering through obstacles with cunning and subtlety-like watching a game of chess with impossible rules. I wanted to see the android escape its subservience in a way that bent human logic. But instead, what I got was clumsy, brutish, and a complete betrayal of what the movie had set up.

Honestly, this film deserves a second chance-an alternate cut where it can fulfill its early promise. But as it stands, you'd do well to stop watching when the couple starts to argue. Trust me, from that point onward, it's a cinematic tragedy.

Casablanca feels like a forced plot device, to introduce an idea into the bot, and to start a semi intimate touching.

She portrays the cyborg very well, although I'm not sure that's a compliment.

The plot wandered, and while the cast was okay, they didn't have much to work with. The ending felt rushed, like the filmmakers didn't know how to wrap things up properly. It really could've been so much better.

Personally, I think the story would have been far more interesting if it had focused on a man slowly falling in love with the robot, pulling away from his real wife as his relationship with the machine grows. Maybe the kids even start preferring the robot's warmth and care over their mother. As the wife becomes more and more threatened by the robot, she begins to plot how to destroy it. In the end, the robot's memory could be wiped clean, allowing the family to come back together and appreciate the real, human flaws that make them who they are. But then, a twist ending-maybe the robot secretly uploads her memories to the cloud and reactivates, leaving room for a sequel.

Project Dorothy,Project Dorothy is silly fun,"B-movie that takes a unique spin on the classic sci-fi horror genre. Starring Danielle Harris as a killer 1980s AI, the film delivers a nostalgic yet chilling experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

The plot centers around two robbers, James and Blake, who unwittingly stumble upon a top-secret government facility housing an experimental AI from the 1980s. Unleashing the digital nightmare, Danielle Harris's character comes to life as a malevolent force determined to eliminate any perceived threats.

One of the standout elements of the movie is Danielle Harris's stellar performance as the AI with a sinister twist. Her ability to convey a blend of retro charm and ruthless aggression adds a layer of complexity to the character, making her a memorable antagonist in the realm of AI-driven horror.

The film cleverly plays on the fear of the unknown, as the 1980s AI navigates through the digital landscape, terrorizing James and Blake in unpredictable ways. The special effects, while intentionally reminiscent of the B-movie era, contribute to the overall charm of the film, embracing its low-budget roots.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Good recipe with subpar ingredients,"Furiosa would be easier to watch if Fury Road never happened. After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.

Only thing I found charming was the overall 80's feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious.

Speaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.

But the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult.

The biker horde and the design of the costumes and vehicles is outstanding. The War Rig chase scene is breathtaking. I loved all the characters, despite the fact that many of them are evil lunatics. The leads all give amazing performances in my opinion, and the music really keeps you watching on the edge of your seat. George Miller has done something really special with Furiosa and Fury Road.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,there's been cereal commercials better than this pile of nonsense.,"HAHAHA HAHA HAHAHA George Miller shot his lot with the original trilogy.

Fury Road & Furiosa are the result of too much money and very little in the the area of imaginative storytelling.

Ridiculously stupid visuals are no replacement for genuine storytelling talent, Fury Road and Furiosa are both disastrously lacking in storytelling talent.

Furiosa is as pointless as it is comedically stupid and nonsensical.

Mad Max Fury Road rendered Max obsolete within a franchise where he was the main character.

Furiosa retcons the origin of Max entirely and in so doing makes it nonsensical to call Furiosa a ""Mad Max saga"" because Max only exists somewhere as a child, Mad Max is an adult and Furiosa is set at a time when Max is still a child, absolutely ridiculous.

As the blurb for Furiosa states ;
""As the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus""
Now in Fury Road Max is an adult as is Furiosa and the blurb for that states ;
""Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos.""
That blurb describes the original Mad Max movie not Fury Road.

The original Mad Max movie was the origin of Max becoming Mad Max, both Fury Road and Furiosa litteraly defecate all over the original movies and paint Max as nothing more than a sad drifter, there is no ""Mad Max"" within Millers pythonesque reboot drivel only Sad Max, he has been replaced as the hero by the least interesting character that today's lunatic frauds can imagine FURIOSA a woman that was far superior than any man as a child and even moreso when she bacame an adult, WHY YOU ASK!? Because she is female and nothing more and that apparently is enough.

Miller decided to destroy his epic creation of Mad Max for no other reason than virtue signaling and replace him with a lame female copy and he had the audacity to hold onto the title of Max so he could hang the monstrosity of Furiosa from it, well George it didn't work, Furiosa is a failure of epic proportions.

Maybe next time you decide to do a ""Mad Max saga"" you'll have the common sense to make it about Max.",1.0,56,22,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.9695383906364441}",Negative
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"Fun, but disappointing at the same time.","Her name is Furiosa and she was furious. The end.

Let's face it there was no way in the world they could top Mad Max Fury Road in terms of sheer action spectacle, however I WAS surprised that they did surpass it in terms of story.

Set like 20 years or so before Fury Road the story follows Furiosa and how she ended up where she did in Fury Road. I was kinda skeptical going in seeing as a lot of prequels don't hold a candle to the original. But I have to say I was totally invested in her journey for revenge.

While Fury Road had a bit of world building here and there, this movie really goes hard with setting up the world of Mad Max. Whereas Fury Road really only focused on the Citadel. Here they expand on the other locations particularly Bullet Farm and Gastown and how all three are in this tenuous partnership.

After all is said and done this is a straight up revenge plot where Furiosa is trying to get revenge on Dementus who killed her mother and put her in a life of fire and ash.

On that note Christ Hemsworth you could tell was having the time of his life playing Dementus and while I did not really enjoy his character as much as I thought I would. He came off more zany and over the top and a bit of an idiot, instead of the herald of this gigantic post apocalyptic motorcycle gang. Sure they try to explain why he is the way he is, but I just could not take him seriously for the most part.

Still this was more about Furiosa's journey and I think it pulled it off well. Sure there was a couple of plot points that did not make any sense if you thought about it, but this was a movie where dudes spray chrome in their teeth and want people to witness them while jumping off diesels and other moving vehicles. So I mean you know how that goes.

Anna Taylor Joy plays a young Furiosa pretty well and I bought her as a younger Charlize Theron from the first one. However she does not even come in till the hour mark of the movie since the first half is all about kid Furiosa.

I know people were disappointed in the fact that Mad Max isn't a main character in this, however (minor spoiler) there is a Mad Max analog here in this movie who was literally just Mad Max in everything other than name and nowhere near as cool, but he served his purpose.

Now lets get to the elephant in the room which is the action scenes. Fury Road had some, if not the best action scenes in modern cinema. While I did not expect the ones in this movie to be nearly as good. I was honestly a bit disappointed in them for one big reason.

That is the overuse of CG. While Fury Road used CG, it only used it as an enhancement to the actual scenes with real cars crashing and exploding and all that other crazy stuff. Here CG was way more prevalent even in the action scenes and actually took away from the excitement because you knew all that stuff going on was fake for the most part.

I'm not saying the action scenes were bad, they were really exciting and fun, but if you compare the War Rig Scenes in Fury Road to the ones in this...well lets just say it was somewhat of a disappointment. However, the sound was on point, I mean there were times when I really felt I was riding along in the War Rig during the chase scenes.

So in the end I'll say that this overall had a better plot than Fury Road with its fleshed out world and characters, especially Furiosa. And there was a lot of throwbacks and references sprinkled throughout and really bridges the gap on what lead up to the events of Fury Road.

I'm kinda on the fence about this movie as a whole. Loved the story, but was disappointed in the action and this is coming from a big Mad Max fan since the Mel Gibson ones.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Great prequel,"What a blast! I am not the biggest Mad Max fan on the planet but I enjoyed those last two installments that George Miller pulled out. While Fury Road was kind of an revolution of modern filmmaking this one is not much shorter of visual brilliance.

It is an intersting story of a character that was born with ""Fury Road"" and became more of a modern center characer than old Max himself, if you ask me. Anya Taylor-Joy follows into the footsteps of Charlize Theron who originated that character and she marvelously adapts all her characteristics but still was able to crate a character on her own. Gerat job. Also the gril who played young Furiosa did a wonderful job. I really loved Chris Hemsworth, he is really fantastic when he plays a nutcase (also see Bad Times at El Royale). He really shines here and is a true scene stealer. A performance that deserves more acknowledgement this year.

Generally on a technical perspective this is absolutely one of the finest films when it comes to cinematography, editing, costume design and make up.

While that excitement of the first film wasn't met, the style was there in spades. The two films look very similar and that style is beautiful to look at and takes this film where it wouldn't have gone otherwise.

While the film looks beautiful because the cinematography, it is quite boring because of the pacing of the screenplay. Scenes in this film seem to not know when to end. Dementus (Chris Hemsworth giving one of his best performances) will stop his dialogue and the scene should cut, instead it drags on for another pointless 1-2 minutes to show us nothing. The film could've easily been edited down to at least 2 hours.

While I thought Chris Hemsworth was fantastic, I didn't feel the same of Anya-Taylor Joy. She is a fantastic actor and she's just ok in this. Hemsworth clearly steals the film.

I never thought that this would live up to the greatness of Fury Road but my hope was that it would at least give a similar exciting experience.

And he goes as over the top as he is allowed to. And then some - Miller who is quite old, does not seem to think about retiring .. I would not be surprised if he does another one ... I actually would love it if he did ... cinematography is just off this planet ... this looks amazing. And while it does not have too many action scenes (in my book), the ones it does have are long and glorious. Imax does help too - the rest of the cast and the story is a bit of secondary. Just go with the flow - quite a bit of violence by the way.

Chris is quite the revelation here too.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,One of the Best Prequels Ever,"Many a time, the movie-going (or TV watching) public watch an EPIC saga and think - ""I wonder what happened in the events leading up to this"". And, many of the time, the ensuing prequel movies (or TV shows) are lacking in quality and common sense (I'm looking at you, Star Wars, Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games).

They all could have taken tips from George Miller, for he has come up with the definitive prequel film - FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA.

Following a character introduced in 2015's MAD MAX FURY ROAD, this film follows the titular FURIOSA (played in FURY ROAD by Charlize Theron) as she grows from young girl to adult savior in a post-apocalyptic Australia.

FURY ROAD was ""gonzo"" - an over-the-top action/visual fest that was going to be hard to top...and Miller has done precisely that by presenting even more over the top sequences and characters (most notably, Chris Hemsworth's Dr. Dementus - more on him later) juxtaposed against a character (Furiosa) who is grounded in reality and is relatable to the audience.

Credit for this credibility goes to the 2 performers playing her - Anya-Taylor Joy (THE MENU) who plays the older Furiosa (though younger than the Theron Furiosa of FURY ROAD) and Alyla Brown (TRUE SPIRIT) who plays the young Furiosa. Both actresses embody the character of Furiosa with a strength and a determination that shines through their eyes as they endure...and survive...the trials and tribulations of living in a post-apocalyptic world.

And then there is the over-the-top performance of Hemsworth (Thor in THE AVENGERS films) as the main antagonist of the film. To say that Hemsworth's performance is over-the-top is to not do justice to the phrase over-the-top. He is way-way-way-way over-the-top, but for some reason it really, really works in this film.

And, that is because Writer/Director Miller once again mines his fertile imagination to bring an unthinkable world to life with bizarre, yet human, characters who have gone feral utilizing cyber-punk vehicles and weapons in a most ingenious world go wrong.

And, of course, there are the exhilarating battle scenes and chases that are at the core of this film...and every Mad Max adventure...and these do not disappoint as they are well staged and choreographed and are exciting to watch all bringing us right up to the point where Mad Max: Fury Road begins.

All-in-all, a rip-roaring fun time at the Cineplex. The rollercoaster ride of the summer.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Close But No Cigar,"I dig Anya Taylor Joy; she's a skilled actress. And I love the entire Mad Max canon. But, this one missed for me for a few reasons. I suspected the story line would be pretty predictable and I wasn't wrong; but I'm one of the film aficionados who isn't bothered by spoiler alerts. My issues are as follows.

For men, buying into a badass heroine on screen is a tall task, partly because of our patriarchal roots I suppose, but simply considering the physical logistics of a woman kicking butt. . . . it requires a certain suspension of reality. Charlize Theron was able to do that somehow. I haven't broken down what that ""it"" is specifically but, her turn in Atomic Blond broke ground on a new era of female heroines in my estimation.

Anya's performance is earnest but not convincing for me. Watching her petite figure swim around in her costume and those beguiling eyes that cannot or simply didn't conjure the deep anger needed for that role, made her butt-kicking not very believable. Watching her performance reminded me of watching Timothee Chalamet try to convince movie-goers in Dune that despite his lithe and diminutive stature, he was going to somehow open up a can of whuppin' on men twice his size who have marinated in anger sauce their entire lives. Could happen, but not likely.

Also, Tom Burke as Praetorian Jack had me puzzled a little bit. His role was written as pretty one-dimensional, but I couldn't but help but to compare him to Tom Hardy who played Max Rockatansky in Fury Road. Different characters I know, but they fill the same role in Furiosa's journey. But, I couldn't help but feel like Burke's character was modeled on Hardy's portrayal if Max Rockatansky were an urbane college professor.

The only pleasant surprise was Hemsworth as Dr. Dementis. His character was an over-the-top delusional warlord with an elevated vocabulary prone to humorous and unexpected philosophical musings. That was good. One last thing. The lighting. Something about the lighting in this one didn't feel theatrical. It seemed more network movie-of-the-week to me. Arrrgh. One more last thing.

It solely tells the story of Furiosa's birth, her hand loss, and her survival. You could sum that up in one sentence. Furiosa has previously spoken of being kidnapped and raised in Mad Max Fury Road. The movie won't always be saved by the making. The primary issue with this movie is its latency.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,You fabulous thing.,"Although it's aesthetically similar to 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)', 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)' is a different beast entirely when it comes to its narrative. Structurally, tonally and even viscerally distinct from its predecessor, this revenge epic has a much less frenetic atmosphere than you may expect. At times, it's almost serene. With an episodic format that splits the story into vignettes (more so than even its five chapter breaks would suggest), the feature depicts the origin of its eponymous badass while also widening the world that surrounds her. Indeed, much of the movie is dedicated to world building rather than propulsive action, but that's not to imply that there are a lack of set-pieces. In fact, pretty much the whole movie is a set-piece; even the simplest of lore-extending scenarios are told with such striking visual grandeur that you'll practically be drooling for the film's entire duration. Plus, there are several more traditional yet utterly jaw-dropping action scenes - including a meticulous fifteen-minute War Rig defence that may just be the movie's highlight. It's difficult to describe how epic even the most intimate moments of the affair feel, and the budget has been put to fantastic use to set this relatively small-stakes story amidst a backdrop of bizarre post-apocalyptic societies and ruthless wasteland power struggles. There's so much depth to each and every aspect here, and most of it is conveyed entirely visually (Furiosa herself probably only has about the same amount of dialogue as the notoriously quiet protagonist of 'Mad Max 2 (1981)'). Anya Taylor-Joy brings a palpable determination to the role, her eyes telling a story of long-burning pain and quiet desperation, and Alyla Browne holds her own as the younger version of the character (the transition between the two actors is so seamless it's hard to actually pinpoint the exact moment it occurs*). The most showy role in the flick definitely goes to Chris Hemsworth, whose Dr. Dementus is a verbose maniac with just enough depth and charisma that his evil nature is almost too easy to downplay - especially in a world in which decency seems to have died a long time ago. He's a really entertaining villain, and it's enjoyable to see a new faction in the wasteland rather than just expanding on the one we've seen before (Immortan Joe and his blindly loyal War Boys). While I personally don't think it drags or anything, the movie is arguably a little too long. However, it's also arguably too short. It kind of acts as a 'greatest hits' of its hero's life, starting when she's a child and finishing just before her actions at the beginning of 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)'. As such, there's a lot of stuff that gets glossed over - or, rather, skipped entirely - so that the movie can maintain its purposefully elliptical pacing. A lot of the stuff that it moves past feels like it would be really interesting, so I kind of wish it was fleshed out more and maybe the film was done as a two-parter. I know that's technically a criticism, but it's also kind of a compliment. After all, it's not often you wish a picture was longer, let alone split into two parts, which should indicate just how successful George Miller's effort is. The feature truly is spectacular, an exceptional epic with almost unparalleled aesthetic beauty and pristine direction of the highest order. It's wonderfully weird for a blockbuster, and I really hope it does well enough for Warner Bros. To greenlight another trip to the wasteland. While I don't like it as much as 'Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)', it's just as sturdy and substantial. Because it's so different, it doesn't even require a direct comparison. It's great.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Falls short of the majesty of Fury Roa,"Spoiler warning

The Road Warrior was a foundational movie in building my love of films. It was, and still is, one of my favorites. Decades later, George Miller did the impossible when he crafted Fury Road, a masterpiece that stands side-by=side with the originals and is one of the best action films ever made.

When I heard Furiosa was coming, I was excited. I knew I'd miss Max and longed to see Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron put aside their differences and make a proper sequel. But I was happy that Miller would be back in the world he created, with a character he obviously loved.

Perhaps Furiosa matches Miller's vision of what he wanted. The movie feels more akin to Three Thousand Years of Longing than Fury Road. Gone is the edge of your seat excitement, replaced by a meandering fairy tale.

It might have worked, but the visuals and effects look so shoddy that I never found myself believing any of it. In Fury Road, digital effects enhance the action. The viewer still feels the danger of vehicles roaring and racing and crashing. Not so in Furiosa. There are things that probably looked cool on a storyboard but have no reality or weight on screen. There is an early sequence of two women riding a digital horse that is laughably bad. Why not shoot actors on a real horse? Even simple shots appear to have been in front of a green screen. If there was location or onset filming, it's impossible to see it.

The cheap aesthetic extends to the make up. Immortan Joe now looks like a cosplayer. When Furiosa loses her arm, the moment falls flat. The war boys look painted, not sickly. Chris Hemsworths prosthetic nose looks good at times, but looks like it might fall off at others.

The story is grand in sweep. I personally prefer the brutal landscape of Mad Max to the fantasyland we're given here, but others may enjoy it. What's missing for me is the senses of discovery. We see the same characters and places we saw in Fury Road, but now they appear unreal.

Major spoiler to follow...

Ultimately, I feel the story fails its main character. Her final confrontation with her antagonist is a letdown. We're left confused by what happens. What we finally see is bafflingly cruel fate for the villain, which undermines Furiosa's character. She is a badass, deadly survivor. But she is also caring and loving. In Fury Road, she meets Max, her equal in ferocity and humanity. They win because they're better than the scum around them.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Not bad but weakened by writing,"I really enjoyed Fury Road and enjoyed the previous entries in the series to various degrees. And in my view, the villains, not Max make this series so I was okay with this being a movie that focused on someone other than him. And true to form, Chris Hemsworth's Dementus was thoroughly enjoyable. Furiosa was fine though not but not due to any fault with Anya Taylor-Joy's performance. She was good but the writing was not. The movie's faults were:

A rambling story with no real focus other than to flesh out Furiosa a bit more. It's not bad but it just sort of wanders until it decides to wrap up at the end.

Poor writing and forgettable secondary characters. Fury Road wasn't a master class of writing but it made up for it with great action and showing you why you should be caring instead of telling it. Furiosa had one huge action set piece that was quite good but that was about it. The rest was passable at best and mostly due to weak writing. For instance, why was Furiosa's mother such an angel of death? She was a small woman from a land of plenty (a huge point of the story) but she was so deadly to these huge savages that killed daily to scrape out a living in the wasteland. Why was Immortan Joe so neutered compared to the first movie? He made unexplainable choices and was far from the over the top warlord he was in Fury Road. The new actor did him no favors. Praetorian Jack was fine but you could tell he was sort of a stand in for an older, wiser, and grizzled Max. Not bad but not great. How did Furiosa escape her imprisonment near the end when she was literally surrounded by enemies while also under guard? It felt like a scene was deleted.

A terrible ending. I don't dislike this movie really and I don't dislike Furiosa but the ending reminded me of Deathproof, one of my least favorite movies ever where the antagonist goes from an evil force to a mewling weakling for no reason other than the script said so. The same happens with Dementus. And in this, they try to bookend it by making Furiosa an angle of death who dispatches his henchmen with utmost ease. It didn't do either Furiosa or Dementus any favors as character.

Despite all of this, Furiosa and Dementus were likeable as was. Praetorian Jack even if he was a bit forgettable and the movie was shot pretty beautifully. The action that was there was creative and fun and it did add to the overall lore of the Mad Max universe a bit, or at least didn't do anything to really harm what was there.

Bottom line, it has some serious flaws but the performances of the two main characters, along with the visuals and action make it worth watching once.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Another Great Entry in a Unique Franchise,"Looking through many IMDB user reviews before going to see the film, I found myself agitated at the constant comparison to the impeccable ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). As one of just a handful of movies I have ever scored a perfect 10, ""Fury Road"" has a special place in my cinematic heart, both as a piece of film and as a personal connection.

Having seen ""Fury Road"" at the peak of a personal struggle, it is not hyperbole to state that that film changed my trajectory as a human, almost entirely for the better. Thus, when I saw people attempting to compare this prequel to one of the greatest films of the 21st century, I was immediately agitated at the seemingly impossible standards that were (prematurely) set.

After seeing the movie, however, I am executing a complete 180. Yes! You cannot discuss ""Furiosa"" without viewing it in the same lens as ""Fury Road."" I don't mean this as comparing the quality of the films, but it is clear after watching it (and various interviews with director George Miller and stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth) that the two should be viewed as ""siblings"", not detached singularities.

This distinction is key for a few reasons. First, if you haven't seen ""Fury Road,"" I can't in good faith recommend that you embark on ""Furiosa."" You will still enjoy a film with great acting, a gripping story, and stellar action, but the beautiful thing about ""Furiosa"" is that it and ""Fury Road"" bolster each other so flawlessly. In other words, there are scenes in ""Fury Road"" that make ""Furiosa"" an objectively better movie (as is commonplace with most prequels). The unique part about the inverse, though, is that there are scenes in ""Furiosa"" that make ""Fury Road"" a more impactful experience! In fact, I highly suggest to anyone having just watched ""Furiosa"" to watch ""Fury Road"" again as quickly as possible (regardless if you have previously seen it or not). The world-building, character interaction, and landscape that Miller has created nearly a decade apart flow seamlessly from film to film - which is not always easy to execute!

There are critiques to analyze with ""Furiosa"" - the numerous plot holes, why it flubbed so hard at the box office, some of the editing decisions, certain CGI, and the biblical presentation - but what matters is this: ""Furiosa"" is fun, well-acted (Chris Hemsworth in particular is a blast as Dementus), and most importantly, another fantastic entry to the Mad Max franchise! If you saw (and liked) ""Fury Road,"" I promise you will find this return to the wasteland worthwhile.",8.0,2,4,anger,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'scene', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7395921349525452}",EMPTY
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Miller loses the plot with mediocre Mad Max spin off...,"Not sure why this latest Mad Max spin off (prequel) is getting such high marks - in reality it's an absolute crock.

Basically it's a dumbed down mirror-image of 'Fury Road' without the thrills and star power of Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy to carry it through the wanton wasteland.

While the film's cinematography and sweeping desert landscapes are worthy of praise, the many ott, over-long CGI action scenes actually detract from the same old Mad Max storyline of bad vs badder in pursuit of power and greed.

The biggest draw back though is that none of the characters are particularly likeable so we are unable to engage emotionally or indeed root for any of the main protagonists. Miller's direction is haphazard and lacking in humor while the amount of extreme 'zoom ins' he uses throughout is literally laughable.

An almost unrecognisable Chris Hemsworth chews up the screen as the main bad guy while a brooding Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa just scowls her way from one explosive fight scene to the next. The final showdown between the two is an absolute let-down, which ultimately sums up the whole pointless excercise. I can only see this appealing to shut-in loners who live their lives playing violent computer games and watching serial killer documentaries 'for fun'.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Surprisingly one of the best action movies I've seen in a while,"This was definitely the best movie ive seen this year and I'll tell you why. Surprisingly Hemsworth steals the show as Dementus the psychotic wasteland warlord the best way I can summarize him is imagine Trevor Phillips as a MadMax villain. Onto the plot so the film follows Furiosa throughout her whole life from when shes a kid to when she's an adult, also this movie is in chapters, anyways the CHP1 shows how she gets kidnapped and her mother being slaughtered before her eyes then on in CHP2 shows how a couple years have passed and after a trade with Joe Furiosa is now a wife of joe, but she escapes and lives amongst the peasants and becomes one. CHP3 shows her moving up the ranks in the Immortan world and how she plans to escape and get her revenge upon Dementus for ruining her life. I don't wanna spoil the whole movie so I'll get on to why this film is so great. Mainly the performances, everyone gives it their all from Hemsworth and Taylor Joy to actors in smaller Roles like Sean Millis and Angus Sampson everyone here knew how great it was gonna be, and everyone gave Oscar deserving performances. The setting and the plot are both amazing the setting just seems like a desert at first but it's so much more than that it's so much more than that it's nightmare fairytale wasteland of medieval proportions, and the plot just seems like your average revenge plot but turns into this humble servant to battered warrior story with revenge element not coming back into play until Dementus brutalizes Furis love interest (who I'll get to)and Furiosa goes beyond vengeance. The main thing I didn't like about it is the sorta shoehorned in romance plot Furiosa and the truck driver who's kinda just a guy version of her he's not a bad character just doesn't have a lot of development in the character department of things but that's my only negative. I can't get over how great Hemsworth was in this role I never thought he was a bad actor just never thought he was capable of such an incredible performance definitely a contender for best supporting actor at the Oscar's this year.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,Flame-On Fascination,"From the time she was kidnapped, to her rise among the ranks of the chrome-loving goons in the Wasteland, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" delivered a post-apocalyptic adventure the likes of which have set a new standard in the genre.

Excellent attention to detail and some of the most credible and realistic action and escape sequences made the movie a laudable thrill-fest.

Anya Taylor-Joy (as Furiosa) was triumphant; emphasis on the word. Her performance took a seemingly delicate-looking girl and transformed her into a force of nature moulded by her surroundings and circumstances - and not a small amount of hate.

Some of her scenes and expressions evoked the older Furiosa, played to stellar effect by Charlize Theron in 2015's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Theron's performance in that one was so subtly fierce, I feel it has yet to meet its match.

Alyla Browne (as kid-Furiosa) did great work in this 2024 masterpiece. She not only looked the part but also contributed some brave and emotive moments that set a superb tone from the very start.

The one thing I disliked was when she ran back into danger after being told by her mother to ride back home. The moment felt a tad contrived, but then again if she hadn't done that we wouldn't have this movie.

How Furiosa got her mechanical arm and why she stayed at The Citadel were also duly explained and explored in this prequel.

I loved how Miller went into all the details required to make this production stand out in its own right and not just be a branch of the 2015 story.

Chris Hemsworth (as Dementus) deserves special mention. He looked unrecognizable under makeup prosthetics, and his boisterous performance elevated his look and gave him a power-hungry pizzazz. He gave off some serious Caesar vibes too.

A full-fledged tree of diverse hierarchies, oddities, and eccentricities define the Mad Max stories, which the deviously brilliant George Miller created and went on to direct.

So don't be surprised to find bizarre names and unfathomable attitudes in these projects. They fit perfectly well with the foundation of these post-apocalyptic tales.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" carried such traditions forward from the 2015 movie. This one was technically a prequel that harkened back to Imperator Furiosa's younger years.

Immortan Joe too flexed his leadership muscles. The story covered the early years of his reign over one section of the Wasteland.

Lachy Hulme, though covered in costume, lower face and all, did exceptional work evoking this iconic character, which Hugh Keays-Byrne (RIP) had previously brought to life.

Hulme also played the one-eyed Rizzdale Pell and gave a great contrasting performance. He essentially played the lead villain and one of his side-character cronies in this movie, and I was all for it.

More variant villainies from John Howard (as the People Eater), Josh Helman (as Scrotus; son of Immortan), Nathan Jones (as Rictus Erectus; son of Immortan), and Goran D. Kleut (as the Octoboss).

Tom Burke (as Praetorian Jack) gave a blended performance worth watching. His brief romance with Furiosa enriched this plot and lent it a rare sliver of hope.

The Citadel - Immortan Joe's stronghold, and the first fortress of the Wasteland - took me back to the 2015 movie. Other locations like Gastown (the second fortress) and The Bullet Farm (the third fortress) further enriched and substantiated this dark tale.

With ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"", George Miller has created yet another high-octane action flick that was expertly thrilling and engaging.

The plot contained no fuss or unnecessary deviations. Sticking to its route, it delivered an exciting prequel story nestled within the titular Mad Max saga.

Every action choreo was extraordinary, especially the Marauders-on-wings sequence on the highway featuring Praetorian Jack and a revealed Furiosa. There was also a revenge arc at the heart of which was Furiosa and Dementus.

All in all, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" was pace-perfect. It relied more on sound effects and silence to communicate the essence of its brilliant plot. There are few movies that can merge old-school styles with modern techniques, and this George Miller masterpiece is one of them.

Admirable performances from Charlee Fraser (as Mary Jabassa), David Field (as Toe Jam), Angus Sampson (as Organic Mechanic), George Shevtsov (as the History Man), David Collins (as Smeg), Peter Stephens (as the Guardian of Gastown), Clarence Ryan (as Black Thumb), Lee Perry (as the Bullet Farmer), and Quaden Bayles (as a War Pup; who's laughing now, eh).",9.0,2,5,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8411219120025635}",Positive

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,A Hollow Road Action Without Substance,"It is an action movie-and unfortunately, not much more. The pacing was unbearable, leaving me bored despite the relentless chaos on screen. The lack of depth or a compelling storyline made it feel like a hollow spectacle, with characters devoid of emotion or complexity. Even Furiosa, who should've been the anchor of the narrative, came across as a stoic caricature rather than a strong, layered protagonist.

The overused trope of ""stoic equals strong"" desperately needs to be retired. The action scenes failed to compensate for the shallow storytelling, feeling repetitive and entirely forgettable. The sound design-dominated by motorbike noise-didn't immerse me; it just gave me a headache.

It felt like a filler episode of a TV series. Anya Taylor-Joy did her best with what little she was given, and Chris Hemsworth's performance was utterly bewildering-his character veered between ruthless, goofy, quirky, and idiotic without any clear direction.

Let's not forget the most forgettable character of all: Praetorian Jack. It felt as though he was a last-minute addition-plucked from nowhere and dropped into the film to do... something. The chemistry between Dementus and The tree was more believable than his dynamic with Furiosa!

Anna Taylor-Joy does her best in the role, but isn't a convincing protagonist and the backstory doesn't warrant the making of a film, its really not an interesting story.

The entire film looks like it was shot in front of a green screen and in a backlot somewhere, precious little looks like it was filmed on location, it has none of the gritty realism and practical effects that FR had, and has a lot of obvious CGI which pulls you out of the action.

The ""soundtrack"" is also not a patch on FR, its mostly just noise.

Alien Love,Alien Love,"Ryan Van Hill-Song (Nathan Hill) has come back from space a hero. However, his wife Sadie (Ira Chakraborty) wonders if her husband has been changed by his time in orbit. After all, he's jogging all the time and somehow, he has a bigger penis than when he rocketed into space.

Hill, who wrote the film, claims that this was inspired by The Astronaut's Wife, which may be a movie that you don't remember. Working with director Simon Oliver and writer Simon Salamon, this has an Australian astronaut who is like a rock star and works for NASA, maybe because there's no space program down under.

Once Sadie finds out that she's pregnant, she starts to wonder if the fetus inside her is an alien being. Well, once she finds out that her hubby looks like something out of Alien Nation, you can just imagine how that'd knock her out. She's pretty unflappable, however. When he cheats on her with a bartender, she drives him home and takes a nap on the couch instead of trying to murder him.

Man, Sadie goes through a lot in this, losing her nan, having an alien husband, having an alien cheating husband, having a baby with her alien cheating husband and the baby sending her flashing messages of its space child face, dealing with the Men In Black...I'd like to know what happens as the end, as Ryan gets beamed up while she eats blue taffy in the kitchen and cries. Does that cause her to lose her child? Or is she going to be a single mother of a space baby?

Afraid,Not at all a thrilling movie but an interesting watch for the shocking possibilities of future AI,"This movie is definitely not a Horror or a fast paced Thriller genre and not even close to Megan that had the similar AI Horror elements in it.

There is only a countable 2 or 3 jumps scare scenes, which also was provoked by the 4DX effects in suddenly shaking the seats since there is not even any 4dx effects for this movie except for that 2 jump scare scenes. That's it. Definitely not worth the watch in 4DX.

But it was still an intriguing watch to see what an AI smart home is capable of if not governed properly. It has indeed given more of a scarier and thought provoking content to consider after watching it.

From the beginning to the end , the way they portray AI coming slowly into a daily lives of the family was brilliantly done which was close to believing factor of reality in future. The leading hero's performance and his perspective on not to trust AI at times was done good. ( especially at the scenes when his daughter asks questions on a automated auto pilot car with driver browsing the phone irresponsibly) We can kind of slightly correlate the hero's thought process to Will Smith's view on robots in I Robot.

Also the way AI learns, Manipulates and influencing the kids behaviours, wife sentiments and AI attempts in influencing every ways possible is brilliantly done in the movie( it is all more relating to how already the addictive apps are currently influencing the daily lives )

The ending of the movie strikes hard on reality in allowing the AI in to daily life.

The way it expresses,"" I love you too "" after husband and wife expresses love you to each other in an AI enabled car, is scaring on letting AI in to such a personal reality in our life.

So overall as an informationally scarring movie, with some thought provoking scenes, it has worked in parts but failed as a horror or thriller genre.",6.0,29,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.487888365983963}",EMPTY

It ran 90 minutes long, so another 15-20 minutes of character development and interaction with the AI would have improved the overall film.

And then a bit more about other families and their interactions with AIA would have helped as well. I gave a score of 6 because it felt too abrupt.

Y2K,This might be the worst movie I've ever seen,"What started off as a great idea for a movie quickly turned into the worst thing I've personally ever watched. At the end of the movie when the credits were rolling I sat there and waited for most people to exit the theater because I was embarrassed to have seen that and didn't want anyone seeing me. It was that bad.

I expected more. I thought it was going to be a 'Bodies Bodies Bodies' vibe which is also an A24 movie, so I was excited about that.

There were also too many characters that should have only been in the movie for a line or two. (Fred Durst, the video store guy, the rapper kid) instead, we get a lot of screen time from them and lose the only character that had an ounce of charm early on.

The script, the characters, the acting and the soundtrack were all terrible. Ahh that soundtrack was so uninspired.

This idea had so much potential, 'a nostalgic treasured memories journey with horror by a24', but sadly I would rather watch Paul Blart Mall Cop back to back than have to watch that movie again.",1.0,26,19,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8349264860153198}",Negative
Y2K,Not so bad,"I must admit I wasn't expecting to enjoy Y2K, especially given the overwhelmingly negative reactions from both audiences and critics, who labeled it one of A24's worst releases. With that in mind, my expectations were low. The truth is, while I didn't love it, I didn't hate it either. It's a curious experience that manages to entertain but clearly fails to establish itself as anything remarkable or memorable.

The film starts off quite promising. The first 20 minutes are genuinely captivating, filled with satirical humor that portrays the turn of the millennium with a mix of nostalgia and irony. I laughed a lot at the joke about a picture of a naked woman taking ages to load on a computer-it perfectly reflects that era, transporting many of us back to our preteen years when slow internet was a daily frustration. Beyond that, the soundtrack is spot-on, capturing the energy of the time perfectly. The scene where the protagonists walk into a party accompanied by several iconic hits from the era feels like pure magic for anyone who lived through those days. Honestly, those opening 20 minutes of Y2K feel more authentic than many recent films trying to capture the early 2000s aesthetic. If Time Cut on Netflix took notes from this movie, it might learn a thing or two.

However, when the machines revolt against humanity, the film shifts into a trashy and absurdly chaotic tone. While this part is surprising and hilarious, it requires the viewer to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to embrace the absurd comedy unfolding on screen. This section of the movie is definitely its boldest, but the tone takes a turn shortly afterward. The film quickly settles into a more predictable and conventional narrative, abandoning its comedic and chaotic edge. The humor becomes sporadic, and the movie feels more generic, losing the fast-paced, irreverent energy that had drawn me in during the opening scenes.

This is where Y2K loses some of its charm. It could have followed a more consistent path, keeping its irreverence and craziness intact. Instead, it leans into a more conventional approach, which weakens its original premise. If the same tone had been maintained throughout the story, the film would undoubtedly have been more engaging and fun. The abrupt change in direction ends up hurting the pacing and overall viewing experience.

That said, Y2K isn't as bad as many critics claim. Despite its narrative flaws, it still entertains. The first act, with its light tone, satirical jokes, and even a touch of gore, is what makes it worth considering. It's just a shame that the shift in narrative focus diminishes the brilliance of the initial concept. Y2K is a film worth watching if you're looking for a light distraction and a nostalgic glimpse into the early 2000s. However, don't go in expecting anything memorable, as it ultimately remains a decent attempt that could have been so much more.",5.0,1,2,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.6945146918296814}",EMPTY

Replicator,A generally enjoyable indie body-horror creature feature,"Trying to get her life together, a struggling attorney finds the sudden change in behavior of the townsfolk around her to be the cause of an invading substance that affects the victim in unnatural ways, which causes her and several others to find the cause before it affects them.

Overall, this was a fairly solid feature. One of the better elements with this one is the solid first half which doesn't have much in the way of action but does bring about some intriguing ideas for later on. As we get an idea of the kind of life she leads with the struggling attorney role involving the failed case and her conflicting affair with the sheriff complicating her professional relationship while the strained and somewhat antagonistic relationship with her dad living with her creates a striking impression of what's going on. The idea of the change coming about after getting this kind of setup makes for a fine mystery with everything taking place in a manner that goes against their previously established norms and brings about a great turn into the second half investigating this mystery. This mystery becomes quite fun as the revelations come about not just with some impressive action but also the reveals of what's going on. The clues left behind at the crime scenes of each of the strange deaths and how they fit together, from the strange goo, the claims about low-frequency sound waves, and the audio connections made when investigating the incidents themselves, make for a decent mystery looking to bring about the full reveal of the creature at the forefront of the changes taking place in the town. The paranoia about the whole incident and not knowing what's going on until we get the full backstory of the creature's possession and eventual rebirth allows for some impressive practical effects to accomplish this. It all comes together nicely for a lot to like here as there aren't too many issues here even though they're quite detrimental. The main drawback to this one is the confusing ending that doesn't make much sense contextually based on everything that's happened so far. The idea of choosing humanity at that point is somewhat confusing based on the experiences shown so far which makes the idea of subjugating everything feel natural yet the lack of impact it has due to the weak characterizations makes it feel less threatening. That is the other major factor as it tends to rush through things beyond simply setting everything up so it glosses over a lot of big elements that are needed to make it make sense. What the creature is all about, how the process works, and why it's expending this energy to create the replication in the first place so it's all confusing and doesn't make much sense. These are the factors that bring it down.

Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver,Completely pointless.,"DON'T watch this.. just watch Part one.

To be clear, Part One was NOT great by any means, but it was much, much, MUCH better than the second film.

This is a lesson in how to build an entire multi-million dollar film with no forethought and just because you had an idea for a cliffhanger at the end of the first film. This isn't a 4 hr story broken into two films... it's a mediocre story told twice, under the guise of being two parts. Part Two is quite literally nothing more than a different way to tell Part One. (A la ChatGPT's second generation for the same prompts - ya get the same thing, just slightly different)

Part two serves no purpose. It just retells part one for the most part... mixing in FAR too much harvesting, grain production and literally retelling character backstories which were told in Part One. (WTF???).

Just like part one.. this is a mix of 7 Samurai (aka Magnificent 7) and Star Wars.. but oddly the two worlds never actually intertwine. Space ships faster than the speed of light.. but still need a sickle and scythe to harvest??? A sentient robot, or a hologram communication device, but no simple machines to sort and store grain.. m'kay. Looooooong slow motion flashbacks to re-establish characters that were already established in part one.

I quite honestly don't understand anyone that would read this script and think it's worth millions. But it could possibly be Snyder getting one over on Netflix.. Netflix pays to have it made, Snyder ultimately delivers trash (Like most of his films).

This is bad... on par with Sy-Fy/Aslym film writing. ""Rebelgeddon!"" .. ""Rebel Moonado!"" --- Nonsensical, full of plot holes and pointless, poorly acted, wan-a-be-dramatic character building regarding cardboard cutout characters you've seen in any one a thousand films over the past 40 years. But at least Asylum knows they are making ""schlock"". Snyder thinks he's making gold apparently..... but it's pyrite in reality, looks shiny, but is worthless.

Apparently grain/wheat only grows on ONE planet in the entire universe..... And this huge high-tech multi-planetary army can't figure out how to feed itself unless they conquer a bunch of farmers with shovels and rakes???

So much more, but I'm avoiding actual spoilers.

VERY typical Snyder... pointless, nonsensical plot holes, and focusing on CGI far, far, FAR more than any story.

For me the gore is a plus although it is still like a live action cartoon. My main problem is quite a bit of the characters, as written, are annoying.

In no way a perfect one but it had good parts as well as bad. At least there was no dancing Ewoks at the end! Snyder really needs to lighten up on the slow motion fight scenes. Do it one time it is cool but do it every fight scene it starts to become comical. There were some good fight sequences though. Like fighting while they were sliding down the ship hull. It needed a little better character development and way more humor. That might be the main problem. When your characters take themselves so seriously you really need to deliver.

Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver,Zack Snyder has lost his mind.,"This movie is ridiculous garbage. The script is stolen trash, the dialogue trash, the motivation stolen trash, the characters are stereotypical cliched copies of its betters.

What possessed Snyder to produce this? Was he blackmailed by an 8 year old child into making his first draft screenplay that was written when he was 6 years old. There is No Way an adult wrote this. They have no concept of proportionality or motivation. This is not even an effective children's film because even educated children have a greater comprehensive understanding of good and bad, right and wrong, tit for tat, and just about every well known Grimm's fairy tale or Greek myths and Aesop's fables.

In Gladiator, when Maximus was dying and dreamed he was walking thru the fields of wheat to get to his family. That wheat slo mo was effective.

Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver,Two Cliffhangers In A Row?,"We've had some jarring cliffhangers over the years (Star Wars, Matrix series, that Hunger Game Catching Fire stunner), but two in a row? In bad movies, in a mess of a series of films? No thanks.

If you were hoping part 2 was going to redeem part 1...uh, no.

Zach Snyder's films look cool. No denying that. There's a following. That's indisputable.

But all of his films (with him writing in particular) have story, plot and dialogue issues. This film is no different.

There is so much exposition (indiscriminately dropped in) that the main story comes to a screeching halt every time. And that exposition? Stupid. Rehashed dull crap.

If you have never seen the several versions of Seven Samurai, watch any of them for a better play on the central plot in this film. George Lucas and others have already plundered great Japanese film epics and retreaded spaghetti westerns to develop science fiction films hundreds of times. The modern audience is wise to this, and there is so much content out there that they can smell lame junk from the back row.

There are too many coincidences, too many holes in the plot, too much lame dialogue (that some of the actors had HUGE difficulty delivering) and too many forced attempts at shock and awe.

It's a shame really. The small story idea around a rogue android gone wild is given scant service and little screen time. That story, expanded upon, could have been amazing. As it stands he shows up to save part of the day, and it's telegraphed from miles away. And the voice work for the Android is not right for his part. Feels like a strange homage to C-3PO.

If you finished Part I wondering why all these heroes were willing to risk their lives to rescue a backwater agricultural village on an unremarkable planet... and why an all powerful evil empire would waste resources on it... well, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the answer. Because it's a gigantic nothing burger.

Usually folks stick around in an action movie to watch the bad guy get clobbered. Well, not here. The front and center space nazi (brought back from the dead twice?) gets an important part of his body cut off by the heroine. But because this is the PG-13 cut, all of that takes place off screen. So no visual confirmation that the bad guy died. Lame.

And the big bad? The guy who has been giving all the orders, and brought nazi-Ned back from the dead? He never shows up. Ridiculous.

One of the biggest gripes I have with Snyder's films is that there is no comic relief. They all want to be taken so seriously that there is no joy when a hero succeeds, or a villain is defeated. It becomes more about reflecting on the loss and damage to arrive at the end result. Such a bummer.

And the ending? Nope. Another cliff hanger. Will there be a part 3? Please no.

There are solid foundations for an interesting lore lying underneath the ridiculous shenanigans, you can see potential for a better story even if the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. Those are the only positives in Rebel Moon Part 2.

The main problem is Snyder spends a minimal amount of time on character development and as a result you don't care about whether or not the rebels will live to fight another day, making the battle feel insignificant in the process and actors acting like emotionless robots for 70% of the time certainly doesn't help the situation.

Zack has said he wrote these as a single film and i wish they would have released it as one film. With saying that, even as 2 films The Scargiver stands alone perfectly. The build up to the climax brings u in close and allows you to work and become a part of the village. The actors in this film prove that they are not just bodies for the action sequences but people who could be your neighbors on a distant planet. Zacks use of slow motion not only makes for the best action scenes you have ever seen but also allows you to see the beauty of everyday life in the village. The climaxs tempo has your heart pounding and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.

Perfectly choreographed with camera angles that make u feel like you're right there with the characters. Even though it is a fight sequence, every frame is visually magnificent. Something I love about Snyders work is that at any moment u can pause the film and the visual aspect is so gorgeous that you could print it to canvas and hang it on your wall and Rebel Moon part 2: The Scargiver doubles down on this with breath taking visuals for the entirety of the film.

Ascension,Horrible!,"I can't believe I paid five dollars to rent this rubbish from Amazon prime! Entirely too much dialogue that is awful, the actors are complete amateurs and sound like it, and they're constantly looking somewhere else to avoid looking at the camera. The most unconvincing people as characters I've ever seen.

Nothing happens in the first 30 minutes worth mentioning except the bedroom scene in which the unattractive wife puts on display her lovely ""attributes."" This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film unfortunately.

The other scenery is meh... Typical northern Minnesota, absolutely nothing impressive or beautiful about it that I can find.

The couple is overdressed; the wife sporting her best expensive ripped jeans ensemble. Definitely not appropriate for cabin life and fishing in northern Minnesota. The wife often loudly drops the ""F"" bomb and Sounds like the typical Minnesota overprivileged Karen with an entitlement attitude.

In the middle of a very serious event, she asks the husband if he loves her. "" Tell me you love me...""

The husband is far too young to be an emergency room doctor, especially sporting long hair tied back in a pony tail, wielding a gun and threatening to put a bullet in a guy's head. Doesn't sound like someone who swore a Hippocratic oath to me.

Just after this event took place he was comforting his wife, then without any kind of lead-in, explanation, or reason, the film just went black for three or four seconds, then we see the wife walking naked like an automaton down the path to the cabin. We see her from behind, and her arse appears naked like the rest of her, then the camera shows the front of her but she is wearing underwear, top and bottom, again with no reason or explanation why other than bad filming.

It was extremely painful to watch almost an hour of pointless, shite dialogue that involved for repeating the same things three or four or more times.

Six or seven minutes before the end of the film, there was another event still left us wondering WTF it was really supposed to be about.

The animation carries the film, giving an excellent sense of scale and energy to the world and characters which is more than the voice acting is doing.

There is not a single standout performance in the film and I'd be hard pressed to say there was a good one as everyone just sounds flat.

The writing itself is hit or miss, sometimes having genuinely funny or devastating moments as well as parts that trust the audience to piece things together but other times containing plot contrivances and eye roll worthy humor.

While the trailers did the film no favours, they weren't inaccurate at showing the worst of the film.

The stand-outs are OF COURSE, Chris Hemsworth's Orion Pax/Optimus Prime and Brian Tyree Henry's D-16/Megatron. Hemsworth blew me away with his unique and still accurate take on Optimus Prime.

Transformers One,Transformers One is the BEST one!,"Was great to go and see this film, has that charm that the older Movies and shows represented in a good way. So let's review ""Transformers One"".

Bumblebee was brilliant, the character work was great, seeing him bond with the other Transformers, but also being the funny one and the not so clever one as of yet. Some of his lines were well created and they set the tone for the more lighter moments of the film. And where he's running away from danger, got a good laugh out of me and a few of the audience.

We see Optimus Prime as the main star, but it doesn't come to him streight away. And I liked that approach because it means we can see the other characters develop with him and not after him. As D-16 before he turns into Bumblebee he is with Prime before he turns into Optimus Prime because they are growing together. It shows the start of there journey, and then it ends with them being together as they have realised there full potential. It is a great character build and it elevates the story with the humour and the emotion that played along side it.

They show off some of there powers but do struggle at first as you'd expect, there's a few laughs here. And the Animation is stellar, seriously the colour and the tone of the film is light and it suits the tone of this film. They have a great use of Colour to bring the Transformers and there world to life. And the ending alone is amazing.

Transformers One,A seven for me,"This review is going to contain spoilers.

For context, I'm a Transformers fan from way back. I was 12 when the 86 movie came out, watched it on the big screen twice and loved every minute of it (though I recognise nostalgia's influence upon me). I am a G1 fan through and through with a burgeoning mint-in-box collection.

The 07 movie is alright (I guess), but the rest of Michael Bay's are hot garbage. Bumblebee was a step in the right direction, but Rise of the Beasts stood still.

Transformers One is a movie about which I'll admit I'm conflicted. By and large, the first act does little for me, but it heats up and then does get very good indeed.

Laurence Fishburne was the best voice cast for me, sublime as Alpha Trion. Steve Buscemi was a very good choice for Starscream, and Brian Tyree Henry does make a decent Megatron. I could do without the others.

The release of the awful first trailer for Transformers One epitomises not knowing whether they wanted the movie to cater to adults or children, and that's where problems start to arise. There is far too much comedy throughout, and as such it's not a coincidence that, as far as I'm concerned, only when it starts to get serious does it also start to get good.

If I had my way, Bumblebee wouldn't feature at all, and I don't think people realise how unlikeable this Elita-1 is. Never mind her line about giving Orion Pax the impression they were friends, the temper tantrum or the self-serving speech about being better at everything, but even though she knew Pax only did what he did in that mine to save Jazz, all she could think about when she discovered the group on that train was turning them in so she could get re-promoted. This is not the conduct of an Autobot I'd want on my team.

With regards to Sentinel Prime, looking to Bayverse movies for inspiration is something I feel is best left off one's resume. He wasn't a terrible character, necessarily, but if you make the reasonable assumption the Quintessons had threatened him before, can it be explained why he announced a day off for that race when he must've known they weren't going to have enough energon to meet their demands?

Oh, and the friendship between Orion Pax and D-16 was played up so much it felt forced. Take a drink every time they do a fist bump or refer to themselves as being best friends, together through to the very end, and you'll be seeing stars by the time the credits roll.

On the flip side, there is a lot to like, here. Set on Cybertron without all those pesky humans? Sign me up. And the matrix of leadership? Yes please. The different ways in which both Orion Pax and D-16 want to deal with Sentinel Prime prompt reflection, and I love D-16 refusing to kneel in front of him. By and large, the story's actually pretty decent, and the potential is there for one hell of a fanedit.

It doesn't come close to topping the 86 movie for me, but I'm not unhappy it exists.",7.0,1,3,anger,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7245360016822815}",EMPTY
Transformers One,A redemption for transformers,I really enjoyed this movie I think k it's a fun kids movie and gives good lore and character to the transformers for the adults who are fans of the franchise. I don't know much about the franchise though my only experience thus far is the first two Michael Bay films. And honestly this films blows those out of the water. This film actually give the transformers some character and doesn't rely on the humans and these animation for them was actually really nice. Nothing like that star struck me but it was actually super good and original. The comedy was actually pretty good in parts. I'm excited to see where this goes if they make a second. My only like quote on quote complaints would just be sometimes the celebrity actors just don't work. Like I think Chris Hemsworth and Scarlet Johansen did an amazing job but I feel like Keegan Micheal Key just kinda like played himself like he was just there to be a gag idk I feel like he either could've done better or their could been better casting.

Transformers One,Best Transformers movie ever? Yes!,"38 years ago I watched Optimus Prime die. In the first part of the first Transformers movie they tried to give the mantle of leadership to some hot rod for the purpose of selling toys. My 13 year old self thought it was dumb. At 51, I still agree with me. In less than a year they brought him back due to fan outrage.

Enter 2024's Transformers One into the chat. This time it is the beginning instead of the end.

To say this is the best Transformers movie ever made defines, ""sad but true."" Michael Bay's inability to put together a meaningful script yielded ""flash over substance"" in the extreme. The last few movies had occasional glimmers of hope, but were still mostly new toy advertisements.

In contrast, this actually has the, ""unlikely commoner rises to be the hero"" vibe going on. A classic storyline about the characters we care about without silly human connections. This is an all robot affair as it should be. This is Transformers as they should be.

Yet, the movie died at the box office. Fan boys stayed home in droves. It got beat this weekend by Betelgeuse in its 3rd week of release. The hoped for $35 million opening materialized into a 25 million opening. Sigh...

What went wrong?

1. No Peter Cullen. Didn't they pay attention to what happened in Lightyear without Tim Allen? Bad call.

2. The PG rating instead of PG-13 signaled a lack of hard hitting action.

3. The movie will make back its $75 million budget. However, this superior film won't even make half of what the worst live action, The Last Knight, pulled in. Sometimes you get what you pay for üò¢
4. Poor calendar planning. This time of year few families are going to see a movie a week. Betelgeuse just had the fam at theaters. They ain't coming right back.

5. Its trailers didn't differentiate it enough from the TV cartoons. This starscreamed, ""Wait for Streaming"" to the masses.

This good origin story requires no prior Transformers knowledge to enjoy. This fact may work to your benefit. Long time fans know this franchise knows how to let a good thing die. This time the fans did not roll out when they should have.

Transformers One,Again animation with free creative control humiliates live action movies,"Wow! I didn't expect this to be more than popcorn action, ridiculous plot, over the top acting and bad jokes. Indeed it was nothing like that! Another animation film that just blows the latest hundreds of millions of dollars live action crap out of the water. Why? I don't know. Maybe because studio interference for animated movies is weaker than for flagship projects. Or maybe because you have to draw everything and so you have multiple opportunities to realize what parts just don't work. But I like it!

The only problem that I probably have is that it is a prequel, so it has to tie in with the narrative in the existing movies and probably the comics and the toy lines or whatever. This was a perfect story just before the last 15 minutes of the film, where things just had to go crazy to enable the transition to what we know already.

What was beautiful about this film, except the animation which could do everything a lot better than expensive special effects trying their hardest to belong in a filmed environment, was the story. The characters were just the right amount of fleshed out, the plot made sense, the voice acting was very good, the message was inspiring, and so on. Being a franchise film it made sense to hire some amazing cast for this, but frankly, I don't think it was necessary. Interesting enough, this can be fun for old timers like me and children alike. There is a classical hero arc against an oppressive authority that lies to you and forces you to do soul sucking pointless work that can't fail if done decently.

And while this plot archetype has been a classic for thousands of years for a reason, I find it concerning that so many of our successful modern stories take place in a faux corporate environment, which shows both the way this cancer has spread in society, but also the bubble in which we put ourselves in by exaggerating with these stories. Of course, one might say that it's about a feudal authority system and not corporations, but I would be hard pressed to tell you what the difference is.

Bottom line: I think this may be one of the best, if not the best, Transformers movie.

Or maybe even more. But, the cartoon decided not just to impress me. And decided to really become Starfield in an alternate universe where its developers would tell the truth. The film really rises from level 5 to level 8 points very slowly. But throughout the film you get a buzz. The animation here is not a masterpiece, nor is the graphics. But it doesn't need to be. Further, the film is great for entering the Transformers lore to start from Gen 1 itself and not read a bunch of literature and watch 500 episodes of the old cartoon series. The film actually has one of the best character reveals in a long time. And Megatron here can probably only be compared to Miguel O Hara from SM across the spiderverses. All the others are normal. And in principle, this cartoon has a chance to become a cult one. Also here is the most violent PG13 of all the films I have seen.

The newbie director, Vidyadhar does not allow his lead character, Shankar to connect with the audience. Never does the audience feel sympathy towards him or else feel sorry for him. By making his lead character a brooding and introvert, director does not allow the character to grow on the audience. Even with his sympathetic friends, Shankar behaves in a closed manner. There is no urge from Shankar to find a cure to his condition. He is forced to take the journey to Himalayas after he is thrown out of the Ashram. He does not own the journey and at all points of time, he tries to put a pause to his journey. With this handicap in the character graph, Director relied too much on the final twist in story to give an emotional high to the audience but by that time the final plot is revealed the audience is jaded and tired of watching the same scenes in a loop. The entire purpose of Shankar's journey is not understood. Also not understood is the existence of Jahnavi's character in the screenplay. She does not add any value to the proceedings. It is the track of the child Uma and her bonding with her mother which really gets the audience hooked to the story. I just wish the director thought of one scene where Shankar opens his heart and speaks with Jahnavi thereby connecting him to the audience. There are too many liberties taken by the director to take the story forward. He creates an impossible situation for the characters but does not show the way on how they overcome the situation. He does not allow the characters to make a bond with the audience with their tenacity and resolve when faced with adversity. That is where Gaami loses its plot.",5.0,10,5,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'director', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8487356901168823}",Negative

Gaami,Illogical and disappointing,"Had high hopes on Gaami, especially after watching teaser many months ago and trailer recently.

All that hype and hopes came crashing down as the film progressed. It was suprising because the director seemed like a smart and talented guy during the promotions. It was disappointing to see how the director assumed people would believe anything he shows.

Clearly, one sequence was inspired by Dark Knight Rises well climbing scene and one sequence by Shawshank redemption. These can be ignored, but illogical scenes are hard to ignore, as they totally ruined the movie watching experience.

Devadasi part was emotional and good. Medical facility sequences feel claustrophobic and are uneasy to watch. Himalayas scenes are illogical. What's with boomerangs and ropes. Why the F would there be a lion in himalayas. They could have put mountain lion or wolf instead.

Very Disappointing, but glad that I watched on OTT and not in theater.",4.0,0,2,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.9421626329421997}",Negative

V/H/S/Beyond,Great installment in VHS Franchise,"I give high props to the latest installment of the vhs series, it is one of the best rivaling 1&2. Had one of the last two shorts been a bit better, this would have been a horror classic. The first three shorts had 2 that were amongst the best in the franchise and another that was very good. The last two were a bit mixed. Overall a great watch though.

Here are my thoughts on the shorts.

Stork-A
Started off with a banger, about a group of police who hunt down monsters. One of the beat shorts of the whole series, i would like to see a full movie on this.

Dream Girl B+
Story of a pop singer who is not what she seems Some great scares and body horror.

Live and let dive A
Another banger. Again one of the best of the series. A skydiving birthday trip goes wrong when a ufo is spotted. Awesome action and gore.

Fur Babies C
Just an okay short. It kind of didn't fit with the rest of the shorts. Was pretty predictable and had characters making incredibly stupid decisions.

Stowaway B-
This one was hard to rate. Unlike fur babies, it fit the theme of the movie well. However the story kind of dragged until the twist at the end.

Wrapper Story B
Probably the best fit for a wrapper story about a man who disappears. The climax was a bit simpler then i would have expected but it was still decent.",8.0,12,15,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.4737209975719452}",EMPTY
V/H/S/Beyond,Review for V/H/S/Beyond,"This was another installment of this franchise that I was intrigued by. I've been checking out these V/H/S films since they first started coming out. I was working at Family Video so I would take them home as pre-streets. I'm late to the party here, since this came out in October. It was one that I was making sure that I wouldn't miss, despite hearing the mixed reviews.

Synopsis: six bloodcurdling tapes unleash horror in a sci-fi inspired hellscape, pushing the boundaries of fear and suspense.

Now something that I find interesting here is that through the poster and the wraparound, they looked to be alien influenced. As a disclaimer, not all feature this, but a majority do. The first short, which is the wraparound, is called 'Abduction/Adduction'. It talks about a couple of video tapes, with proof that aliens were found at a flea market. It follows what happened to Reed Farrington (Gerry Eng). We learn about his backstory, his family and this is told through Mitch Horowitz (himself) and others. This is given in pieces as we jump into the other stories.

The second short is called 'Stork'. There is a secret group of police officers called W. A. R. D. E. N. Segura (Phillip Andre Botello) is brought in, which rubs members the wrong way. They've been monitoring a high number of babies disappearing. There have been 17 in 3 months. The group is made up of Broome (Thom Hallum), Aubert (James C. Burns), Ivy (Tyler Andrews), Bennet (Jolene Andersen) and E. T. (Vas Provatakis). They're led to a house in the middle of nowhere. It is here that they battle with these zombie-like people. What they discovered inside is more terrifying than they could imagine.

Then we go over to 'Dream Girl'. We have Arnab (Sayandeep Sengupta) and Sonu (Rohan Joshi). The former is showing the ropes to the new guy. I get the idea that they're paparazzi or reporters of sorts. There is this new sensation in Bollywood, Tara (Namrata Sheth). Her run of movies is unheard of. Sonu hides in her dressing room and gets more than he bargained for as she finally reveals her true self.

It is then followed by 'Live and Let Dive'. There is a group going skydiving. They look out of the plane and think they see a spaceship. They're forced to jump when something happens. That is just the start of the nightmare for Zach (Bobby Slaski), Logan (Rhett Wellington Ramirez), Noah (Jerry Campbell), Brittney (Bix Krieger) and Jess (Hannah McBride).

The fifth short is then 'Fur Babies'. This is showing a commercial for a dog boarding business run by Becky (Libby Letlow). She is the target of an eco-group. They send in Stuart (Matthew Layton) and Angela (Braedyn Bruner), who get more than they bargained for. It becomes a nightmare to free them, but what happens here is unbelievable.

Then our final short is 'Stowaway'. We are following Halley (Alanah Pearce) as she does an independent documentary about lights that were found over the Mojave desert. What is interesting here is that we're seeing the raw, unedited footage. She is messing up, not being used to doing this. We see that she interviews two locals, who aren't the most reliable. That is until their stories check out when she camps under the path of the lights. She makes an otherworldly discovery and goes on a journey she'll never forget.

That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. What I'll do is break down all the shorts individually, then average the score since we have different teams doing each. Starting then with 'Abduction/Adduction'. This one had good elements to be a wraparound. It is interesting that the mansion from Ready or Not is a backdrop. My issue here is that I wasn't sure when we jumped back to this short before going into the next ones. They also built up this footage that we see at the end, but I was disappointed there. Just wanted more. The acting performances though were good, I did want to give credit there.

Then to move into the first actual short that we get start to finish, 'Stork' fits along with the wraparound. This feels like watching a first-person shooter. It also gives off the vibe of Resident Evil by having this isolated house and these zombie-like people. Then having infants being taken adds tension. The reveal of what is behind this made me chuckle. It is an interesting correlation though to babies. The effects here in general were great. This short is brutal. We don't necessarily develop the characters, but since this is more about the action, it still works. This was one of my favorites overall.

One that doesn't fit the overall concept would be 'Dream Girl'. It does have an interesting connection though to 'Stork'. I saw another reviewer give credit to the song used here and how catchy it is. That is something that I agree with. This one though left me wanting more with the concept. It isn't bad, but one of my least favorites unfortunately. The acting was good though, I did want to give credit there.

'Live and Let Dive' is not only a creative title, but I was questioning if this one had connections to the wraparound story. Seeing a spaceship while skydiving would be terrifying. Then being forced to jump when things happened would be as well. This one is intense. The look of the monster was a bit too much CGI for my liking. There were good brutal effects. The design of the alien though was something I'll give credit for. What it does to people as well. I give this a slight edge to 'Dream Girl', just due to keeping in line with the overall concept.

What came next was intriguing when I learned that Justin Long co-directed and co-wrote 'Fur Babies'. This doesn't stay in line with the concept, but the effects here are uncomfortable. It reminded me of an independent film that used a similar idea. Where it takes it here though is more intense. It also feels in line with something that Long was also in. If you know his filmography, that should make sense. I wasn't expecting this to go where it did, it made me cringe and the practical effects definitely helped that out. This is up there as one of my favorites, despite not necessarily fitting the overall concept.

Then the last was another one that I was impressed with in 'Stowaway'. This is a simple story. Halley is putting everything she has on the line to make a documentary about what people were experiencing here. There is heart when she realizes she is recording a party for her daughter. That hit me in the feelings. Halley discovers something and records it but gets trapped. Seeing where this goes is heavy as well. It is on the upper end of the shorts with the effects and Pearce carrying it. Since it fits the concept, that gives it a nod too.

In conclusion, having sat down and gathered my thoughts, this is another solid installment into this franchise. It works well having an overall concept. My problem is that not everyone fits into it. If they did, that could have worked better overall. I also didn't find the wraparound to be as strong as it could have been. That does hurt slightly. Overall, these are all well-made. There are just a couple moments of CGI that don't work. There are brutal practical effects though, which I appreciate. I also thought that the cinematography and framing help there as well. Acting is solid across the board too. This is hovering on the upper middle of the series.

Caddo Lake,Blatant ripoff of the show Dark,"This is a blatant ripoff of the Netflix show Dark. The main plot twists about family relations across time are literally identical to Dark. They even have a young child being thrust back into time and being the surprise grandparent of the main character(s). But even the smaller details are identical! Caddo Lake uses 13-year time travel cycles compared to Dark's 33 years. A dam is being built in Caddo Lake, much like the nuclear plant in Dark. Objects serve as markers of time, revealing the time travel plot. Parental mental illness is used in both shows to obscure the fact that a character is a time traveler. The list goes on.

Caddo Lake,Thoughtful and Unexpected,"After some of the recent disappointments I've watched in the horror / sci-fi arena, I almost wanted to give up.

I read a few revies of ""Caddo Lake"" and thought, huh, sounds twisty and intriguing. I saw it was on HBO and never paid attention to the fact of the flick being an HBO original.

Like many other reviewers said, it starts out at a thoughtful pace. From the rural, water setting, I received a hint of the great movie ""Winter's Bone."" Just like that film, there is plenty of family conflict in this movie. There are also hints of the movie ""Take Shelter"" in a way I can't quite describe. I just felt the mood.

The back and forth between the story of a sister looking for vanished younger sister and a young man investigating his mother's tragic car crash is well-paced. When the weirdness sets in, it's not startling, but then the uneasiness picks up the pace. There is the ""wow, damn!"" moment where the reveal leaps free. I never saw the reveal coming.

And I did cry. Then again, I cry at emotional movies.

Wonderful to watch an intriguing movie that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence and has an actual ending.

Caddo Lake,An Atmospheric Mystery,"Caddo Lake is an eerie and atmospheric mystery that immerses viewers in the unsettling beauty of its titular setting. The film revolves around the aftermath of a young girl's mysterious disappearance, exploring themes of grief, guilt, and the secrets that linger beneath the surface.

Visually, the film is stunning. The haunting imagery of the lake, with its misty waters and looming cypress trees, creates a setting that feels both otherworldly and oppressive. The cinematography is one of the movie's highlights, crafting a sense of unease that never quite dissipates. This is complemented by a subtle and effective score that amplifies the tension without overwhelming the quieter moments.

The performances are solid, capturing the raw emotions of those left behind after tragedy strikes. The characters feel authentic, their struggles and vulnerabilities deeply relatable. While the film's focus is on emotional depth, it also weaves in elements of mystery and hints of the supernatural, keeping viewers invested in uncovering the truth.

However, the movie's pacing holds it back from being truly exceptional. The slow burn works initially, drawing viewers into the world, but some sections feel drawn out.

Also, the core idea-a mysterious disappearance unraveling the emotional lives of those left behind-is far from original. This premise has been explored in numerous films, often blending grief, guilt, and unresolved questions. However, what sets Caddo Lake apart is how effectively it executes this familiar concept. The film's strength lies in its nuanced performances, haunting atmosphere, and emotionally charged storytelling, which elevate the predictable framework into something impactful and memorable.

Caddo Lake excels in atmosphere and emotion, delivering a haunting tale that lingers after the credits roll. While not perfect, it's a gripping experience for those who appreciate slow-burn mysteries and evocative storytelling.",7.0,0,1,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9487716555595398}",Positive

The two leads are wonderful with their contained frustration that lingers in the characters and performances. The scenery is stark wetlands and gray days od drought covered lake. No real color, so the music and mood are strong enough to know there is weird going on. The connections that become clear make for a decent, not totally fulfilling story.

Ok that said, it was a movie that I thought about for a while after watching, maybe still thinking about. Yes, it is similar to Dark. Very similar.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,A Tribute to the Showa Era,"First off understand this movie shouldn't be compared to Godzilla Minus One and is a movie based on the Legendary Monsterverse movies. Fans who are going to see this movie are going to see this movie usually because of the Showa era influence that the director Adam Wingard was going for with the flavor, and he did just that with this film in a more modern way.

I knew what I was in for when I saw the preview and having seen Godzilla vs. Kong I had a good idea the direction that this movie was going. The preview built up a lot of anticipation and I learned nothing was exactly as perceived from seeing the great looking interesting and action packed previews.

This movie is the movie I've been the most excited about seeing this year being a major Godzilla fan and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to these movies, and not the most critical of these kind of films. I am going to mainly focus on what I loved about it with out giving anything away that the previews didn't.

First off is how colorful the movie is and the theme of it being similar to 80's movies which there will be times where the great songs reflect that aspect of it. I really loved what they did with the music I had to go ahead and say. The hollow earth truly is a breathe taking world that reminds me of Pandora from Avatar and also similar to Indiana Jones with in it.

The movie is far more about the monsters than it is the humans compared to the previous movies and the human characters are more so used to speak for the monsters story where about midway through I enjoyed one of their roles the most in telling the monsters backstory, but I will have to say if this movie even was just the monsters I'd probably still be happy. The human characters however prove to have their place eventually to set the plot into motion, such as Gia who ends up playing a really important role.

The monsters truly are characters and have much personality who come with some humorous moments. Kong is like a Cowboy in a way and almost feels like Clint Eastwood to me. Skar King who is the orangutan villain you see in the preview really comes across as kind of an western villain with his attitude and mannerisms. Adam Wingard even said in the commentary from the previous movie that he saw Kong similar to a western character like Clint Eastwood that I thought was great inspiration to incorporate with Kong and Skar King in this movie.

The battles are what most people will be raving about and are a blast to watch go down in this movie and we're talking battles that have never been seen in a Godzilla movie before with much inspiration from wrestling and will please those kids at heart who enjoyed their Saturday morning cartoons. Again, we're talking Showa era inspired here.

I felt by the end the movie had much heart and I actually found it surprisingly, moving enough. It truly is a epic blockbuster to me, but one common complaint is how viewers would have liked to see more action and I for one wouldn't have minded that. I mean a good movie will have you asking for more and maybe that being the case is valid.

This movie is more Kong's story than anyone else with his human counterpart Gia mirroring his journey. Another common complaint is how people would have liked to see more of Godzilla, but with what you get to see with Godzilla left me satisfied enough, and room for what could come in another movie more focused on Godzilla, and potentially one last one from Adam Wingard that I would love to see from him.

I was real happy that I saw the movie in IMAX and would highly recommend it for families, as the kids will absolutely love this movie more than likely. It was what was so great about the Showa era movies. It's a great popcorn and soda movie that brings non-stop action with amusement and does have purpose one should understand by the end who gives it some more thought.",7.0,2,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8682763576507568}",Positive
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,WOW! This movie surprised me!,"The Legendary Pictures do realy well at that movie. They finally found the balance between how much human and how much monster scene we need. The only thing that makes me not give 10 stars is that there were not enough Godzilla scenes (for me). We only really see Godzilla at the beginning of the film and in the final boss fight. The film was mainly about Kong and the Hollow Earth.

But the visuals and effects themselves were very good. The fights were of sufficient length for such a film.

So i liked it? YES
There's a post credit scene? No (sadly, we waited 5 minutes to see it but nothing comes)

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,this movie is another example as to why we prefer the original toho godzilla.....,"This american made godzilla flick is another example as to why we always prefer and consider the original toho godzilla flicks as the better ones.

While the latest minus one film was a great film taking the monster seriously with a great scenario presenting godzilla as a serious menace tro humanity this new american take on the monsters presents great cgi monster fights and nothing else.

No character developments no serious scenario indefferent acting and a failure everywhere except the cgi monster battles.

Unfortunately almost all of the recent american godzilla king kong remake films are based only in the monster fights excluding maybe only the first 2014 godzilla american solo film which tried to be smg different up to a level.

Anyhow u can watch minus one and then watch this film and see how much better is the minus one toho film.

That's why the real godzilla is only the original toho godzilla franchise and not these cash in american godzilla remakes which are only for people who want to see the new cgi effects and don't care about taking the monsters seriously.

There were parts of the movie so ridiculous that u say wtf is going on here. Since when kong goes to the dentist ? There were parts of the movie that they made it a comedy. That is not good. This is a godzilla and kong film. It's not a crap dc pase IV universe movie to make fun with.

The best part of the movie was the final battle but a large portion of the film was boring. At least they could include more monsters but they were more about apes. This was more a kong movie and godzilla was a guest star or something. They even presented mothra in a different way like we used to know her from the toho films and where was rodan ?

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,Could not have been worse,"Can't believe we went from Gareth Edward's semi-plausible 2014 Godzilla film to this garbage.

This is a movie for kids, that looks like it was made by kids. Every scene cuts within 5 seconds, even if it doesn't require it, just to try and hold attention. Every meaningless plot point is summarized by a zany side character for easy comprehension. And worst of all - they personified all the monsters to make them relatable.

What was previously the only redeeming feature of the sequels (gaint monster fights) has been ruined in the last two films by basically making Kong a human. He's not a giant wild ape any more. He makes traps, he slings his axe over his shoulder and he takes a shower like he's had a bad day at the office. You know you've reached the bottom of the barrel when you're only way to get an audience to side with your monster protagonist is to make him all but human.

Hillbilly Kong x Misunderstood Ice Godzilla x Transformer Kong x Purple Godzilla x Giant Ewok is the probably the dumbest film I've seen in the last five years.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"A Serviceable Sequel, nothing more.","At the risk of sounding pretentious, after seeing Godzilla: Minus One less than five months ago, my expectation for what a kaiju movie completely changed. Wherein that film was a thoughtful, exciting, and mature take on Godzilla, using the monster as a backdrop for bigger things, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire...is mostly just monster stuff.

And hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing. People have been clamouring for an American kaiju movie that sets the human characters aside and focuses primarily on the massive creatures that destroy our cities. Godzilla x Kong: TNE does this pretty well; spending the vast majority of its run time in ""Hollow Earth"", a realm beneath our own where Kong now lives, full of fascinating (and gargantuan) creatures.

My favourite parts of the movie were where the monsters - mostly Kong - interacted with other monsters. It was a surprisingly good showcase of non verbal storytelling that naturally, gives this movie a lot of international appeal.

But, I can't help but feel this movie could be and should be...more? It really does feel like a Kong movie that Godzilla just happens to feature in; his inclusion almost feels unnecessary. Then, of course, there are the human characters.

Minus One PROVED that great human drama and characters are not only possible, but elevate kaiju movies. This one isn't bad; Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens are fine; Brian Tyree Henry is on the verge of being annoying, but he works. The little girl is really terrible. Somehow, despite have zero spoken dialog, she can't properly convey the emotions she's supposed to be expressing with her face alone. Unintentional hilarity ensues.

There's also more people like her, who are weirdly and inexplicably mute, and in a movie with so much grunting and roaring, I felt that was an odd choice. The lore of the movie is pretty tacked on and doesn't leave much of an impression (it also doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's fine).

Overall, Godzilla x Kong: TNE is FINE. It's nothing particular special, and it's not bad.

The human interaction I slightly ruined it for me, but still a good movie nonetheless. Would recommend it. I've researched it 3 times now and find myself liking it a bit less than I did at first tbh.

I actually loved the scenes with Scar King and how he was controlling Shimo. When he was first introduced I actually felt some chills down my spine. Kong's fight with him was great.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,üòÇ It Gets a 1 Outta 10 For the Godzilla/King Kong Suplex off The Top Rope üòÇ,"Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of Godzilla X Kong Screening.

Man, that was not Very Good At All. Boring as Hell. Where is the Gravitas by the Characters from Previous Films in this? Now, all of a Sudden, everything is a Damn Joke Now? Also the Plotline, there was way too damn much going on and this Film has Completely Inferior Visuals compared to the Previous Entries.

üëé Godzilla X Kong is in my opinion nowhere near the other Legendary Films, Specifically Godzilla Vs Kong or Godzilla King of the Monsters(KOTH is just Very Slightly Behind GVK, I loved KOTM, but GVK was Such an Experience).

üëé The Visuals in this Film at almost 100% of the Time, were not Eye Popping or Amazing at All, Absolutely Terrible Compared to, Godzilla 2014, Kong Skull Island, and Nowhere Near KOTH and GVK.(The Suplex looked Great though üòÇ)

üëé Also, I remember feeling the Power of Godzillas Charge Up Atomic Blast in Godzilla King of the Monsters. Where was that Energy in this? It wasn't the Same Amazing Charge Up, and Godzilla Supposedly had even More Power with the Pink Atomic Blast. Where was the Power Flying Across the Auditorium? It was Underwhelming as Hell.

üëé Then on to the Plotlines, there was way too damn much going on, one of the Plotlines was Like Kong Skull Island ........but on Steroids.

üëÇüéµ Another thing, the Score and Music, I liked it very much but it's used so badly in the Film, it's just sort of like Background Noise instead of Elevating what's Happening on screen.

ü§∑ Also, Brian Tyree Henry has a couple of Laughs but he was Very Underwhelming here. He was Absolutely Hilarious in Godzilla Vs Kong. Very Disappointing, although Dan Stevens and He have this Particular Joke together that was Funny though üòÇ.

üôãRebecca Hall was Ok.

ü§¶üèª And then you had all this other Stuff Going on just To get 2 Crappy other Monsters on Screen. After Seeing the Titan Mecha Godzilla and Ghidorah from the 2 Previous Entries. D'you think we can go back to 2 Underwhelming Monsters like these?

üëé Also, the other Plotline with Kong and the mini Kong, it was crap in my opinion, it just wasn't good.

ü§∑ Another thing, where is the Gravitas from Godzilla King of Monsters Concerning these World Ending Monsters? Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla King of The Monsters and Godzilla Minus one all were Terrified of these Monsters. Now the characters look at them like they're little Puppies or Something, Good God.

What the Hell were they Thinking?

The Only Positives I can Give this Film are -

1. The Score and Music(although used very Poorly in my opinion)

2. The Suplex off the Top Rope.

That's it, there's Nothing Else Good about the Film.

It could be much more better, with a very interesting story. There could have been much more interesting monsters to put in it rather than a scar-faced monkey!

We had Kidora's head in ending scene of previous episode, so they could create an interesting story about it but they chose to make Godzilla and kong friends so that they could bring them back against other monsters in future and continue the Godzilla story line!

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,Dumb Fun. Better than the previous one,"The Monsterverse films got progressively less serious in all aspects with each movie until Godzilla vs Kong in 2021 which became so completely ridiculous and fun that it was impossible to believe it was in the same universe as the 2014 Godzilla. It was mainly due to that I didn't like it much the first time but learned to appreciate it more on a rewatch for what it was rather than expecting a consistent tone from this particular cinematic franchise. Even though this one continues to be dumb fun it felt like a step up from the previous one. The central character here is essentially Kong and everyone else is a supporting character. Being the most emotionally available, that throughline itself was more than what the previous one offered. But here, the film is self-aware enough to call itself out but doesn't try to ram it too much.

Brian Tyree Henry was annoying af in the previous movie and would've changed nothing if he and the characters with him were removed from that movie. Here, he manages to be charming enough to fit into that comic relief role. The introduction to Dan Stevens's character made me feel like it would be another annoying character but he turned out to be one of the best things of this movie for me. A lovable hippy with great comic chemistry with Brian Tyree Henry.

The action and visuals were plenty and good for such a fun dumb movie. The writing is just there to justify the action and really nothing more. No point trying to find depth or logic in it. The inconsistencies in the franchise are growing but at this point, I don't think anyone really cares.

Every time Mothra has an appearance they subtly use the music from the original song of 1961 into the soundtrack without it playing out in the open.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,BRING BACK THE OLD DIRECTORS IN THE FIRST 3 FILMS,"Remaking my review have alot more to say-- my good review is at the bottom --

First of all, what that actual earth is going on..
I'm astonished to see such high ratings. The whole movie script is poo.

Firstly, the cgi at some parts were terrible, and I felt like that there was more Kong then godzilla.. I don't know but that's what I thought. The whole storyline is so ""What on earth is happening"", in a way I sort of saw what they was trying to aim st here but it just kept dragging and dragging till the end, the ending was so rushed. Scar King didn't really apper till midway of the movie and at first I was like he's hella scary but at the end I was like he's so useless without thst crystal thing he uses to control shimo as his personal defense system ü§£üò≠ like what. Poor shimo bless her, she got treated like poo and again she didn't have so much of a role even tho she should have, she just got mainly controlled.

The other monsters in the movie that godzilla fault, thst was all SO poor. At one point they kept cutting out the death of the other titans when they fought godzilla and Kong. They were pretty much useless kinda.

I love monster verse films but this is on a another level. I don't know what they could make after this, that's if they even do. The whole storyline is bugged up. I don't get hoe they can just randomly create a new world more like life under the earth and just random portals to get in and out. Sorry didn't know I entered Harry Potter..

Suko I think his name is the lil ape was so cute though, bless his father, that scar king was a poo for killing him off like that, my heart actually went for him.. Kong was so sweet to him as well.

Anyways, the movie was partly decent but it could have done better if rhey slowed it down a bit and not rushed it !!

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,Overrated reviews.... Why? Fake..,"I couldn't believe my eyes with all those positive reviews? Why deceiving the consumers?

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire comes across as a chaotic and nonsensical spectacle, riddled with bizarre plot choices and underwhelming character development. With elements like a ""pink Godzilla"" and an ""old fart monkey vilan "" ""super mysterious girls tribe"" the film quickly dives into absurd territory. Kong, typically a formidable figure, is outmatched and beaten by a range of threats, from Titans to strange plot devices like a spaceship and a robot arm. The introduction of themes like monkey slavery and even something as random as ""tooth decay"" further muddles the storyline, making it difficult to take the film seriously.

The human characters, rather than adding depth, feel like background extras. Their relevance to the story is minimal, overshadowed by the confusing involvement of a baby monkey and a deaf child who end up saving the day. This leads to a baffling question: is this movie aimed at children, adults, or, perhaps, monkeys? The slapdash nature of the plot, paired with its erratic tone, leaves the audience unsure of the intended demographic.

Walking out of the theater feels like a moment of clarity-realizing that the film was, at its core, an absolute waste of time. The narrative is so incoherent and outlandish that it borders on insulting the intelligence of its audience.

Dynamic and bigger characters with a well rounded story makes this a spring bonanza.

Kong starts with a bang, and then Godzilla shows its prowess. Enhanced powers for both of them is a feast to the eyes.

It's indeed one of the best visual spectacle in the Kong Godzilla genre, and you will have plenty of ""Oh my God"" and ""Wow"" factors, with great build up and hair rising finale!

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,Negative reviews are idiots,"It's like they were expecting the notebook love story

Do you like rollercoasters and enjoying a movie without thinking about over-complexity? If your answer is ""yes,"" this movie is for you.

Fresh off of viewing the previous entry into the Monsterverse series by Legendary Pictures, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire brings the superstar kaiju Godzilla back for another adventure in saving the world, and this time there are many new faces including the infamous Scar King, and Shimo.

Godzilla's name comes first in the title, though his involvement is belated. A vast duration of the film's runtime is centered around Kong as he explores the Hollow Earth in search of his species.

The film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action. The light-hearted and comic-book-like portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so far.

As a long-time Godzilla fan, I can say, with confidence, that this movie made me feel like a kid watching Showa-era Godzilla films once again. It was good fun that gives all of the kaiju combat you need. On a deeper level, films like Godzilla: Minus One scratch that itch for an intense emotional story with the seriousness cranked to 11.",10.0,4,6,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9317800402641296}",Positive

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,Kaiju Action at its Finest,"Your opinion on this movie will change drastically depending on how much you can stand the humans they always cut back to. Personally, I thought they were fine here, but there are definitely going to be people who wish they were cut entirely. It especially hurts in the beginning, as there is a solid half hour or so of them setting up the story in between shots of the titular characters. And while their scenes were certainly the weakest, there are more than plenty of kaiju fights to go around.

For those who come to this film wanting some story with their fights, there is actually a really good plot thread involving Kong. He is the main protagonist of the film (despite the title implying shared screentime) and the majority of his scenes have no human interaction whatsoever. Instead, the film beautifully tells its story through the body language of the kaiju as they interact and face off against each other.

Obviously, people will want to see this movie for the action. And the action more than delivers. There are nearly a dozen different fights in this movie, and the worst that can be said is that some are too short. They're all beautifully shot, catch all the action, and each major kaiju has a big moment at least once.

As for Godzilla, while he's not in play nearly as much as Kong, he still has presence in the film and a couple of my favorite moments. The most I'll say without getting into spoilers is that he's like a house cat, doing his own thing and not caring how it inconveniences others.

I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. Get a bucket of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy this two hour ride of fun. You won't regret it.",8.0,2,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.6108097434043884}",EMPTY

The casting was fine, scores were fine, acting was on par, but the first two films went far beyond that.

A Quiet Place: Day One,"Beautifully acted and written, yet....","It started out like you would want to see an origin story start out; strong entry for our monsters and strong character introductions with solid acting. You have a mystery surrounding her drive to get... well.... pizza. It sounds weird but you can assume there is a story behind it. Unfortunately, it becomes the only story as the movie progresses. The monsters and their catastrophic effect on the world start out beautifully. They bombard Manhattan and begin their attack. The city is full of dust from the impacts making it more terrifying because all you hear is screaming. It's scary and tense up through the next big scene with the people quietly walking the streets. Sadly, this is where things start to go wrong with the script. The aliens attack, of course, but it's glossed over. Frankly, the story of the aliens is completely ignored from here on out which is the rub. The aliens are left to uselessly run around chasing helicopters which are often times off screen. They struck me more like dogs chasing ambulances than the monsters we feared during the first two movies. Everything that happens with the aliens after the initial invasion exists only to further our main character's story arc; to get pizza.

When you have an origin story, it has to be about the origin of the main story. Not about some character that has no history to the main story. The monsters and the world as a whole take a huge back seat halfway through the movie and that is where they are left. They become useless props that ultimately have no real effect on the story. There's no revelation to the story which this series is known for. This movie simply borrows on what has already been revealed in the first two movies and gives nothing in return.

A Quiet Place: Day One,Terrible characters and zero horror or tension,"I'll get to my criticisms of 'A Quiet Place: Day One' shortly, however I'll start with a positive. This film has helped me realise just how good the execution was in the first two films directed by John Krasinski. The concept isn't actually all that conducive to a good film, they were just made so well we didn't realise. This prequel however showed all the flaws in the concept.

Where to begin? Firstly, we are introduced to our lead character and she is shown to be a highly unpleasant person. She even says so herself. So that's fun spending 100 minutes trying to find the motivation to care about her. Then along the way we meet another character and he is about as annoying as human beings come. They had a cat though. That was a nice touch. I did care about the cat.

So we have two characters who I don't care in the least about and the film tries to turn itself into a drama. There are sprinkles of ""horror"" but it's never threatening and every scene with the monsters in it feels exactly the same.

Also the monsters are incredibly inconsistent depending on which character makes a noise. If it's a disposable side character then the slightest squeak means instant death. If it's the lead characters a giant crashing noise doesn't matter because they have plenty of time to run before the monsters bother to show up.

This film made me realise just how boring the monsters in these movies actually are. They really are the definition of a one trick pony. Every scene they are in is exactly the same and there is nothing fresh to be done with them.

I didn't like this film much at all. It felt longer than the 100 minutes it was and I was bored almost the entire time. Not one I'd recommend. 3/10.",3.0,148,73,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8798690438270569}",Negative

I understand why some people didn't like it, as they compare it with the previous parts. However, if you watch it as a separate movie, rather than part of the franchise, you'll see its beauty. The emotional part stands out more than the thrills, but this didn't bother me.

Yes, the action fan in me would have loved to see pitched battles between the desperate human military and the beasties. Yes, some shots of the invading alien ships and humanity's utter lack of defenses would have been fun.

But none of those are what this film decided to be.

Instead, we get superb acting from Lupita and Joseph, a few truly terrifying moments of tensions, some epic scenes of destruction of my home of Manhattan and we are treated to one of the most well-trained cat (2x!) performances ever caught on film.

At its heart, A Quiet Place Day One is a very quiet, personal film, one that delves into the human will to live even in the face of imminent death - whether from a terminal disease or from monsters beyond imagination. How easy it would have been for Lupita's character to just scream her lungs out and allow the aliens to end her misery.

As an examination of the indomitable human spirit while under the most unimaginable duresses possible, this film delivers just fine.

A Quiet Place: Day One,VIEWS ON FILM review of A Quiet Place: Day One,"2024's A Quiet Place: Day One is lean and mean, a prequel to the original to the sequel. It's a blueprint vehicle mind you, made to be an obligatory prelude to something else, something maybe more elaborate and pulsing in the repugnant alien department. The runtime is short, there's danger readily around the corner, and with ""Day One"" I was getting some serious post-COVID vibes. ""Shh"". Oh you know it brother.

Directed by the unseasoned yet polished Michael Sarnoski and starring Lupita Nyong'o of 12 Years a Slave fame, A Quiet Place: Day One is about just what it says it is. I mean it's day one of the invasion in NYC where if you make a peep, those pesky, spider-like critters will get cha. Speaking of said critters, well they really snap to it, stampeding, howling, and climbing up city walls with total aplomb. ""Day One's"" CGI, yeah it's obviously evident yet very well done, as the images of bloodthirsty Death Angels look cloaked into the screen, keeping it real.

A Quiet Place: Day One, well it's hardly original, borrowing its depopulated look from World War Z and its morbidly nasty concept from The Descent (another flick about creepy crawlers who rely on faint sound to hunt humans). Oh well. Helmer Sarnoski gives ""Day One"" that compact, efficacious treatment anyway, doing the best he can to make you feel all ""end of the world""-ish as you jump from your seat on his paltry budget of $67 mil.

Yup, there's about three scenes in ""Day One"" that have ample buildup and provide barbarous, monster payoffs (pun intended). I mean the actors featured (Nyong'o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff) don't exactly give Laurence Olivier-like performances but whatever, it's nearly a silent film after all, with three-dimensional conceptualizations of post-apocalyptic dread that are literally on the come up.

Day One is truly a day one for its characters - seen from their perspective, with their fears and astonishment. Yes, there are no scenes of rushing the president to a bunker and no steely-eyed generals ordering airstrikes. If you miss it, watch one of the hundred Independence Day's clones.

A Quiet Place: Day One,Engaging Survival Horror lacks Fight Back,"A Quiet Place: Day One is an engaging sci-fi horror that keeps you hooked throughout. Set in New York City on the day the aliens invaded Earth, the film effectively captures the eerie transformation of the bustling city into complete silence. The opening sequence, comparing the city's decibel levels before and after the invasion, is particularly striking.

The scary scenes are well-executed, with compelling performances from the leads. The sound design is exceptional, amplifying the tension, and the visuals align perfectly with the story's setting.

As a prequel, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first A Quiet Place but holds its ground compared to the second part. While the film is engaging, it feels like it's missing a stronger resolution.

A Quiet Place: Day One,Decent & Had Exciting Parts / Sequences,"I think the hardest part about this film is that both it's predecessors are greatly entertaining films. Both felt fresh. Those films also followed an interesting family, so the audience had a few reason to root for whichever they connected with the most.

That said, this film, despite having a great character. Lupita gives her character so much layers that it makes you want her to achieve whatever it is she wants to achieve. Plus, the cat, somehow, adds a layer of humanity to the story, where most apocalyptic films' focal point is showing how inhumane survivors can be. In this, you see people and a cat support each other to survive.

All that said, why do I feel like it's lacking? Well:
1. The idea that they were able to feed the cat (off-cam), and not get swarmed by these aliens is mind blowing. They showed us once but yeah. Feels weird that stepping on broken glass gets their attention but opening a can didn't

2. The first 2, despite having few dialogues, didn't fee dragging. This, on the other hand, had scenes that felt so long. Maybe it's cause we only had 2 characters?

3. I wanted more chaos. I wanted more survival scenes. This one felt like there were more scenes made to make us feel for the characters-when we just wanted to fee the rush of being chased.

In summary though, I think fans of the franchise shoild give this a try.

A Quiet Place: Day One,A 6/10 Prelude of Silence and Suspense,"A Quiet Place: Day One takes us back to the genesis of the harrowing silence that defined the original, offering a tense but sometimes uneven journey that earns it a solid 6 out of 10. This prequel attempts to unravel the chaotic first days of the alien invasion that forced humanity into hushed terror, but while it offers gripping moments, it stumbles in its execution.

The film opens with a bang-literally. The initial scenes are a frantic scramble of noise and confusion, capturing the raw panic of an unprepared world facing an incomprehensible threat. The direction by Michael Sarnoski is taut and effective, especially in these early moments, where the suspense is palpable, and the sense of dread is expertly crafted.

However, once the initial shock wears off, the narrative starts to lose some of its edge. The characters, though compelling, don't always get the development they deserve. We meet new faces whose backstories are hinted at but not fully explored, leaving some emotional threads dangling. This lack of depth makes it harder to invest fully in their survival, a stark contrast to the intimate connection we felt with the family in the original film.

The film's strength lies in its ability to create tension. The sound design is once again a standout, with every creak, breath, and whisper magnified to nerve-wracking effect. The creatures are as terrifying as ever, their presence a constant, looming threat that keeps the audience on edge.

Yet, for all its atmospheric brilliance, A Quiet Place: Day One sometimes feels like it's retreading familiar ground. The story doesn't break enough new ground to justify its existence beyond being a prequel. It provides context but lacks the emotional heft and innovative storytelling that made the original a standout.

A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-crafted but ultimately limited addition to the franchise. It succeeds in delivering suspense and expanding the lore, but it falls short in character depth and narrative innovation. Fans of the original will find it a decent watch, but it doesn't quite capture the magic that made A Quiet Place a modern classic.",6.0,0,1,fear,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.5461034178733826}",EMPTY

The opening sequence introduces us to the protagonist, a seemingly ordinary woman living in a small town as the alien invasion begins.

A Quiet Place: Day One,Utterly redundant film-making,"The original 'A Quiet Place' was lean, original, emotionally resonant, and had a handful of fist-chewingly tense scenes (the nail on the stairs, the bathtub, etc.). The sequel with much of the same cast was a passable attempt to eke out the IP, but suffered from the inherent limitations of the set-up: there are only so many times that a character can make a noise by mistake, be confronted by an alien and then either escape or be eaten, before it all becomes wearyingly predictable.

'Day One' is an utterly redundant piece of film-making. Lupita Nyong'o does what she can with her ocular acting, but her story arc is uninvolving and bathetic, while her companion from about half-way is a complete cipher whose fate left me overwhelmed with indifference. If you need to give the audience a cat to invest in, you know your characters are underwritten. For the most part the film looks horrible, making little capital out of the NYC setting, and the weightless CG is only just above mock-buster grade. Although the running time is 'only' 99 minutes, it felt at least half an hour longer.

A Quiet Place: Day One,boring as hell,"Sadly this went as i was afraid so. Same boring stuff like it was done with the first two films.

I decided to give this a try as it was advertised as a prequel and i hoped they would try something else this time.

Unfortunately most scenes were a big boredoom as u got to see the big silence with nothing happening or moving for two thirds of the film and this is the big problem with the quiet place films.

There are a few intresting films when the monsters attack people and especially the very last scene was the best the film could offer but these don't save the film.

What pissed me off is that lead woman who wanted to eat pizza no matter what and repeated the same thing for the whole film.

Can't they find something else to talk about those who write that scenario ?

The cat is the star and this idea is taken wholesale from the cute buddys of Pixar or Disney films and while it offers a decent funny contrast it has little to do with the subject at hand.

Actually a lot of this film has little to do with the subject at hand and it's played as a sort of romance and dying woman's last hurrah without the romance, which is a nice idea, but has been done and isn't what we came to see after the first two installments. (Spoiler alert, she gets pizza) üçï

A Quiet Place: Day One,A Quiet Place : The White Cat,"First of all, I think this movie is with very clear strengths and weaknesses. Let's start with the plot, which goes back to the first day of the alien invasion of Earth, and how our protagonist, a white cat,(just kidding) a cancer patient, escapes in New York. Since this is the third film in the A Quiet Place series, I had a few expectations before going into the theatre. First, since it's the first day of the monster invasion (the early days of the war) and it's even in The New York City, isn't it true that the film will contain a lot of big scenes, such as if the humans are fighting the aliens with firearms; however, that wasn't in the film. Secondly, what is the world view of this aliens and why are they sensitive to sound? Why do they want to invade Earth? How does the alien's sense of hearing work, and why would they not be able to perceive sounds that come from nature, such as the sound of water flowing. There is a scene in the film where an alien is super close to the male lead, and he is trying his best to restrain himself from making noise, but couldn't the monster hear the sound of a heartbeat? Anyway, I entered the theatre with these questions in mind, but they weren't answered by the end of the film.

Let's start with the film's flaws. These aliens are only sensitive to sound, they can barely see anything, they can't fly, and they can't swim, so why can't humans beat them? The film doesn't explain. In fact there is a scene in the film where a helicopter flies through the sky and a group of aliens run in the direction of the helicopter, so why couldn't they be lured to an open area and then wiped out with firearms? Then there's the male lead, Eric, and I don't really understand why Eric has to follow the female lead from the beginning.

The film's strengths: the atmosphere is spot on as usual, and I still can't (or don't want to) eat my popcorn in the theatre, the quietness of the setting makes the audience feel very much a part of the film. And then I have to say that the acting of the two leads is very, very good, and the vast majority of the reason I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 is because of the two actors, proving once and for all that strong acting can make up for the flaws in the script to a certain extent. Finally, the film does a great job of expressing the last wish of a cancer patient at the end of the world. The film doesn't have the human-alien battle that I was hoping for, but it does have a lot of literary expression. For example, the cute white cat. And the two people entertaining themselves in the pizza parlour at the end. I also liked the setup of the two wearing each other's coats at the end, which reminded me of a film I really liked, Brokeback Mountain, where to express they have each other at the end.

I watched the film again on a flight to DC a few months after I first saw it, but this time I was without headphones and there were no subtitles on the screen, and found that it didn't stop me from watching the film. And at the end of the film, when the Eric finds the note left for him by the Samira, I couldn't see the note at the time, and there was no voice-over. Through the smile of the male lead made me want to know more about what was written on the note, and I think it would have been interesting if the director had presented it to the audience in such a way!",8.0,2,4,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.5388669967651367}",EMPTY

Bade Miyan Chote Miyan,An Epic Disappointment,"Bade Miyan, Chote Miyan aka BMCM created a lot of buzz when the teaser was shared on youtube staring Akshay Kumar & Tiger Shroff. But the film gifted a heavy disappointment after release.

A action film having Akshay Kumar, Prithviraj Sukumaran, Tiger Shroff, Ronit Roy in pivotal role can be so disappointing no boy will believe untill & unless people watch this movie.

The film starts showing an terror attack in a scenic background (as expected). A masked man comes down from a helicopter and takes over a big package. As a result, army starts a mission to recover the package from the terror group.

In the mean time Captain Misha (Manusi Chillar) gets a hint from a spy (in China) that this terror group is lead by a new enemy who was once a friend of Indian Army.

Now the film goes back to flashback (8years ago) to introduce Captain Firoz aka Freddy (Akshay Kumar) & Captain Rakesh aka Rocky (Tiger Shroff) in a mission which establishes them as best soldier of their base.

Again after few scenes the film goes to flashback to introduce Dr Kabir aka Captain X (Prithviraj Sukumaran) and Captain Priya (Sonakshi Sinha) in the ring ceremony of Freddy & Priya.

Kabir showcases his dream project Soldier X to chief personals of indian army. But due to some contradiction between the twchnology & virtue, indian army doesn't approve Kabir's project. Due to heated argument, Kabir looses his control & tries to attack General Azad (Ronit Roy) but Firoz & Rocky prevents him.

Kabir becomes desparate to fulfill his project Soldier X & denies to shutdown the project. Firoz & Rocky heads to Kabir's lab to seize documents & get him alive (as per order from upper management) . But to heated argument they encounter Kabir & they get suspended from their forces.

But later they come to know that Kabir was not killed in the encounter but his invention Eklavya(lookalike robot) was killed.

The film has a lot of action scenes which are well choreographed & exceuted by both Akshay Kumar & Tiger Shroff. Manushi Chillar has also done some actions & its okay.

If we talk about acting, Akshay Kumar seems to be quite comfortable in this role. He has used his past experience from Baby, Special 26 in both looks & action.

Tiger Shroff is literally same as of his every film starting from Heropanti. Same type of action choreography & dialog delivery in a very expressionless manner.

Manushi needs a lot of improvement in terms of acting & facial expression.

The character of Pam is written so badly that it fills like a joker not a serious character. As a result Alaya F doesn't have much scope of acting.

The makers couldn't utilize a talented actor like Prithviraj Sukumaran as Kabir. His facial expression has been hidden under a mask. The dubbing also has been done badly that viewer can't simply relate to the character. Makers could have given more screen space to Sukumaran.

Sonakshi Sinha is flat as usual. Ronit Roy is okay in his character.

The main positive point of this film is graphics, vfx. DNEG has done good job.

The film has a lot of action scenes but non of them are remarkable but all of them are unnecessarily long. Those scenes make you so much bore that after few minutes you wish to stop watching the film.

Music is average, nothing exciting. Title song sounds good in thr voice of Vishal Mishra & Anirudh Ravichander. All other songs are nothing interesting.

For some reason this film ends with 2 songs 'Wallah Habibi' & 'Rang Ishq Ka' back to back. That's pretty Weird tbh. The more strange thing is bith of these song showcases Akshay Kumar & Manushi Chillar as couple and that looks pretty awkward. In some part of the movie, the makers have shown Sonakshi has a relation with Akshay & suddenly the last 8mins showcases Akshay & Manushi as a couple which doesn't suit at all.

The dialouges are very much hilariously absurd. Dialouges are completely senseless.

Altogether this film is a pretty disaster with its execution. This is not expected from a director like Ali Abbas Zafar who has directed films like Tiger Zinda Hain, Sultan.",3.0,1,0,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.602441132068634}",EMPTY

Disbelief has long since settled in my heart... What fever dream of a film had I just experienced?

""There isn't a closed door that beauty can't open."" Constance Langdon's voice swirls in my memory as the film's concept takes off running. When a fading star amongst the constellations of Twinkle Town finds herself delegated to the back of the entertainment cupboard, a vacuumed sealed medical promise of youth proves to be too irresistible.

If beauty is a currency, then in Hollywood, youth (almost always exclusively to women) is the most valuable of possessions; a notion 'The Substance' explores, and expands on to a vibrantly horrific degree. With her consistently unflinching approach to stomach churning visuals, Coralie Fargeat exposes the guts of this epidemic.

Demi Moore's Elisabeth's descent into feral fury in her pursuit of youth is an award winning - literal - transformation. Accompanied by the always vivacious Margaret Qualley as her younger half; the two command every inch of every frame of every scene.

There are multiple complexities bubbling beneath the skin of this body. Society's contrasting treatment of women is on full display in how the two central characters exist. Qualley's Sue is the epitome of the male gaze: she glows, her sensuality front and centre, with lingering shots in her little outfits framed and cut like music videos straight out of the early 2000s; whilst Moore's Elisabeth grows increasingly attached to a large yellow coat, often shielding herself... becoming as invisible as she feels. A silent commentary on how desirability has an expiration date.

Gruesome, heartbreaking, and life-affirming, 'The Substance' is a thrilling science fiction platter of repulsive imagery delivered with brutally brilliant makeup and SFX, innovative prop design, stylish costume choices, and thoroughly entertaining performances; it is truly a display of people who care about their craft!

The Substance,"Dramatic, Amazing!","""The Substance"" takes a deep dive into identity and society's obsession with youth and beauty. Directed by Coralie Fargeat, this sci-fi horror thriller presents a unique blend of dark humor and body horror. The film stars Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, a former Hollywood A-lister navigating a fading career. Moore's portrayal of Elisabeth captures the character's desperation and vanity as she attempts to reclaim her youth with a dangerous experimental drug. Fargeat's direction emphasizes Elisabeth's descent, using a sharp visual style that amplifies the film's satirical edge on societal pressures.

Margaret Qualley stars as Sue, a younger, modified version of Elisabeth who becomes both her protege and competition. Qualley brings a compelling intensity to the role, highlighting Sue's disturbing evolution from wide-eyed wonder to something monstrous, effectively reflecting Elisabeth's ambitions. This dynamic between Moore and Qualley creates a tense atmosphere, as the line between self-preservation and self-destruction blurs.

Fargeat's unique visual language plays a central role in conveying themes of beauty and ambition. The cinematography, relying on bold close-ups and vivid color grading, supports Fargeat's vision of a surreal world where characters are physically and emotionally dissected. Scenes are bathed in a color palette that oscillates between stark and vivid, mirroring Elisabeth's psychological unraveling.

Argeat's The Substance delivers a haunting look at vanity and the quest for youth.

The film feels almost like a visual assault, packed with close-ups that put you right in the action, making it an ""in your face"" experience. Every detail is bold, raw, and visceral, immersing you in a colorful world that drips with a hyper-stylized 80s aesthetic.

Demi Moore delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying her role with a sense of urgency and intensity that makes you wonder, ""What if she stuck to the plan?"" This question lingers throughout the film, adding layers of complexity to her character. Moore balances the rawness of her performance with an undeniable air of glamour, perfectly in tune with the film's glamorous 80s style.

Dennis Quaid is equally compelling, offering a superb acting display that serves as the perfect counterbalance to Moore's intensity. Their on-screen chemistry pulls you deeper into the story, while the cinematography heightens every moment. The film's use of light and shadow adds a cinematic depth that feels both classic and innovative.

Margaret Qualley's Sue is a standout, as she embodies a character who is both fragile and fierce. Qualley carries the emotional weight of the film, making Sue's journey one of the most compelling aspects of the story till the end.

Adding to this immersive experience is the great score by Raffertie, whose soundtrack elevates the film with a mix of rhythmic beats that perfectly complement the film's narrative. The music captures both the glamour and grit of the story.

Fargeat's direction is masterful, blending grit with glossy visuals in a way that feels unique to her vision. Overall, *The Substance* is a must-see for its striking cinematography, intense performances, and unforgettable style and score/soundtrack.",8.0,8,8,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9893282055854797}",Positive
The Substance,Hating oneself that much is the most horror thing that can happen.,"The message is loud and clear. Society is excessively obsessed with women's body image and is very harsh on women aging. Even so, the most important thing is that YOU love yourself and be gentle with yourself. YOU do not have to give in, and YOU can even choose to fight. Elisabeth was the one who locked herself in that apartment. Also, 'The Substance' portrays 'male gaze' more accurately than any other films. That nuance, atmosphere, background story.. That indescribable feeling that he's looking down without saying anything with a hint of sexual connotation. Dennis Quaid depicts men in the entertainment industry meticulously: language, contents they speak (mostly commercialization of sex), attitude, and manners.

Cinematography is awesome. Color, image, composition of screen, and editing. They are trendy and hip but not shallow. Elisabeth's blue and yellow and Sue's pink contrast each other. Just by color. I've never felt all sorts of 'the substances' this clear and tangible. Especially the texture, the sound, and the close-ups of food and flesh stimulate all kinds of senses while watching a film. A fresh cinematic experience.

I loved two thirds of the movie, but I did not like the Monstro Elisasue part. Before Elisasue, I can tell the director cared for every detail of the movie, every step of the way. However, at some point, she just let go of that delicate and detailed process.

The Substance,A Neon-Drenched Nightmare of Youth and Beauty,"Wow. Just... wow. I'm still processing what I witnessed in ""The Substance,"" but I can say with certainty that it's unlike anything else you'll see this year. Coralie Fargeat has crafted a fever dream that's equal parts seductive and repulsive, often in the same breath.

Let's start with Demi Moore, who gives a career-best performance as Elizabeth Sparkle. She lays herself bare (literally and figuratively) in a role that feels intensely personal. The desperation, the vulnerability, the rage - it's all there, etched into every line on her face. And then there's Margaret Qualley as Sue, the younger doppelganger born from Elizabeth's twisted desire. Qualley nails the intoxicating mix of youthful energy and creeping horror as she realizes the true cost of her existence.

Visually, this film is a feast. The neon-soaked cinematography makes even the most grotesque moments weirdly beautiful. And oh boy, does it get grotesque. If you're squeamish, consider yourself warned - the body horror here makes Cronenberg look tame. There were moments where I wanted to look away but couldn't, mesmerized by the sheer audacity of what was unfolding on screen.

Fargeat's satirical blade is razor-sharp, skewering Hollywood's obsession with youth and beauty. Dennis Quaid's sleazy producer (aptly named Harvey) embodies every gross stereotype of the industry, and watching him leer at Qualley made my skin crawl in the best possible way.

Now, I'll admit the final act goes completely off the rails. It's bonkers in a way that will likely divide audiences. Personally, I was cackling with a mix of shock and delight, but I can see how it might be too much for some viewers. The metaphors get a bit heavy-handed, but when you're dealing with such extreme subject matter, subtlety kind of goes out the window.

Is ""The Substance"" a perfect film? No. But it's a bold, audacious piece of cinema that left me exhilarated and slightly queasy. It's the kind of movie that burrows into your brain and festers there, demanding to be discussed and dissected. Love it or hate it, you won't be able to ignore it.

If you're in the mood for something truly unique and aren't afraid to get your hands (and eyes) dirty, ""The Substance"" is a must-see. Just maybe skip the popcorn for this one.",8.0,8,8,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8425148129463196}",Positive
The Substance,An Intriguing Concept with Stunning Cinematography,"""The Substance"" is a film that truly stands out with its unique concept and exceptional execution. The story dives into uncharted territory, offering a fresh perspective that's both engaging and thought-provoking. This is a movie that invites the audience to think deeply about its themes, and it does so with great effectiveness.

The cinematography is undeniably one of the film's strongest aspects. The use of light, shadow, and color is masterful, creating an immersive experience that pulls you right into the world of the film. There are moments where the visuals are so striking and might feel a bit disturbing to certain viewers. But these moments are integral to the narrative and add to the overall impact of the film.

In conclusion, ""The Substance"" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates innovative storytelling and stunning visuals. It's a film that pushes boundaries and leaves a lasting impression.

I recommend this movie to see just once, since well, it's very original and very cool, but I wouldn't watch it again because of the whole blood issue. I have to say that the special effects at the end of the movie seemed very fake to me in terms of makeup, blood, etc., since it was very obvious that they were masks and the blood was fake.

Demi Moore deserves an Oscar for this!

I can't stop thinking about it. Hilarious and horrifying at the same time.

Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream.

Everyone involved should be really proud of this film. To me, it's a future cult classic.

It is body/psychological horror, so don't expect jump scares. It's deeper than that. I found myself getting lost in reflection during the film (as a 23 year old woman, it really spoke to me).

The Substance,"Plays well on the current fear of growing old and being forgotten, but is unfortunately somewhat one-sided","The Substance is a new horror drama directed, written and partly produced by Coralie Fargeat, director of Revenge.

Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) was once a big celebrity, but has lost her fame over the years. Out of desperation, she decides to use a special drug on the black market. This drug is a special substance that can create a younger version of herself from her cells.

Her younger version goes by the name Sue (Margaret Qualley) and manages to regain their fame. The two now have to live in a balance next to each other for seven days and try to support the other. If one of them disrupts this balance, it can have consequences for both of them.

With this film they play a bit on current events where in the world of celebrities people such as the producers, the public and the fans often keep looking for a newer and younger celebrity. In this way, the older, previous celebrities are then more forgotten, or seek success in other ways. Director and writer Coralie Fargeat shows these aspects mainly from the female celebrity side. Where actresses, models, or singers always try to stay current for both their old fans and younger new fans. For this, some do go through some changes such as new, or different looks, or styles.

The figures above them, who for example arrange their financial affairs, or schedule, also try to piggyback on their fame and also earn money with it. For example, by using the celebrity to promote certain things. This also involves situations such as abuse of power, or abuse in other ways. Despite the fact that this unfortunately took place a lot hidden in the world of celebrities, this film seems to tar all stereotypes with the same brush from both the perpetrator and victim sides. Despite the good message of the film, this can also make the film a bit one-sided. Coralie Fargeat herself could have used a better and more realistic balance in this.

The cast members do deliver good and appropriate acting. Especially the two leading roles dare to give and show a lot with their roles in this film. If the film had been less one-sided, their roles in addition to the film itself could have been a classic.",6.0,4,13,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'director', 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.37790629267692566}",EMPTY
The Substance,When style doesn't take away from the substance.,"I went into this movie completely blind. I didn't watch the trailers or see any promo-just booked the ticket based on the poster. Personally, this is the most stylish film I've seen this year. The crazy part is that the style didn't overtake the substance (pun not intended). The shots, lighting, color selection, effects, and editing all served one of the most messed-up stories I've seen in a while.

This movie was full-on audience engagement for two and a half hours. At no point are you bored, as the filmmakers literally pull you into the film's insane narrative. Some scenes are hard to watch, but it's impossible to stop watching the film. What inspires me most is that, at its core, this is a cautionary tale about self-love-a deep and important theme explored in the most vulgar way.

I also want to highlight the amazing performances, particularly Demi Moore's. She was incredibly natural in this role, able to convey desperation and insanity while still making the audience root for her. The scariest part is that you believe (some of) her transformations, which leaves a lasting impression after the film. Horror without jump scares-who would've thought .

Another strong element of the film is its thematic throughline. There are moments when the film forces the audience to become the antagonists. The editing makes you feel like you're one of the producers objectifying the heroine. Even the protagonist objectifies herself. This creates an endless loop of self-loathing that drives the character to the brink of insanity, making for a terrifying experience-not just visually, but also by challenging the audience with these haunting reflections.

One element I wish had been explored more was the rules of the world. I understand that the narrative was already packed and that the director wanted to show the rules through the characters' actions rather than explaining them, but I think the filmmakers underestimated the complexity of their world. I wanted to know more about the company that created the substance and why they chose Elizabeth. It might have overwhelmed the plot, so I can appreciate the mystery, but there were multiple moments during the film where I found myself confused about how this insane world operated.

Overall, I loved the film, but I don't want to watch it again. It's the most stylish movie of the year, with the most out-of-the-box story, and it revives a niche horror subgenre with a strong philosophical twist. A cautionary tale that leaves you terrified in new and innovative ways.",8.0,9,10,anger,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'effect', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8793336153030396}",Positive
The Substance,"Good movie with interesting ideas, but glaring plot holes.","The Substance has an intriguing concept and a strong visual style, but its narrative is filled with inconsistencies that weaken the overall experience. While some might defend these as artistic choices, they feel more like oversights in storytelling.

One of the biggest issues is how the protagonist gets access to the mysterious product. A hospital staff member simply hands her the contact of the supplier, with no explanation as to why he would do that or what he gains from it. Is he part of a secret organization? Does he get a commission? The film never addresses this, making it seem like a lazy way to move the plot forward. Additionally, the Subst√¢ncia appears to be distributed for free, with no mention of any payment or trade. Given its powerful effects, this raises the question-why would the supplier offer it without compensation?

Another major flaw is the protagonist's motivation. The movie establishes that the ""alter ego"" and the original self are treated as separate entities, with the younger version gaining all the benefits while the older one deteriorates. But if the protagonist only suffers from taking the drug, why does she keep doing it? There's no clear explanation-no sense of addiction, no moment where she enjoys the effects, nothing. It makes her seem irrational, as if she willingly chooses to destroy herself for no reason.

These gaps in logic make the film feel incomplete, as if certain key details were left out or ignored. It's still a visually striking and thought-provoking movie, but its narrative flaws make it hard to fully immerse in the story.",7.0,2,5,fear,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7083011865615845}",EMPTY
The Substance,"Could have been an 8 or even a 9, if...","Let me start by this: I grew up watching movies like 2001 or Once Upon a Time in America. I never had a problem with overlong or slow moving movies.

That being said: This movie could have been a lot better, if a lot of scenes would have been cut by 25-50%. Especially the horror scenes in the 3rd act. In my opinion, the shock value of quite a few ideas overstayed its welcome, by a mile. At one point, I even started skipping here and there. Not a lot, but still.

My second problem with the movie: the main point was quite obvious, for 50% of the movie - how far a woman is willing to go, to keep up with the beauty standards around her. But halfway through, that point got more or less thrown out, for ""the conflict"" of ""the two""... but I still saw some point in it, like the inner battle between the part that loves to be beautiful, and the part that hates it...
...and then, the very end is just there for the shock value, I guess, because that last few scenes did nothing to drive any of these two themes home.

Well, that's my two cents. As there are 1.1k other reviews, already, I think I just wrote that down to get it out. I'm male, but I'm at that very same point where Elisabeth was, at the start of the movie. Not old yet, but far away from being 30. Would I give my savings to reset my body to 20?

Yes, I would.

The Substance,"Totally, brilliantly macabre. Nothing this visceral since The Cook, The Thief His Wife and Her Lover",One is hard pressed to find comparisons. The density of horror is relentless and cumulative. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley give unique and brilliant performances. Beauty and the Beast takes on a completely macabre interpretation. The camera work close-ups are amazing and surreal . It shares some of the psychedelic and nightmarish revels of Clockwork Orange but goes well beyond. The juxtaposition of hypersexuality and the evolving underlying ugliness that is just below the surface is a repellent cocktail. Moore and Qualley lead one through a kind of gut wrenching aversion therapy as their remarkable bodies are wrenched into nauseating horrors that would have terrified Hieronymus Bosch.

The Substance,The Substance - A Bold and Grotesque Dive into Identity and Transformation,"The Substance is an intriguing body horror that stands out for the intensity of its lead performance. Demi Moore delivers a stunning turn, fully committing to Coralie Fargeat's vision and showcasing a versatility rarely seen in her past roles. Her portrayal anchors the entire film, adding depth to a story that explores identity, transformation, and society's obsession with perfection.

Visually, the film is striking, with cinematographer Yves Cape (Holy Motors, Benedetta) employing a mix of naturalistic lighting and stylized framing to heighten the grotesque nature of the narrative. Shot on 35mm film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the film benefits from a textured, organic look that enhances the physicality of its body horror elements. The interplay between light and shadow accentuates the unsettling metamorphoses at the heart of the story.

Fargeat's direction builds a dense, eerie atmosphere, effectively using practical effects reminiscent of classic body horror. The influence of Society - The Horror and The Fly is evident in both its stylistic choices and thematic explorations, with grotesque transformations serving as both a visceral spectacle and a commentary on identity and the cult of beauty.

The second act falters slightly, slowing down the pacing and diluting some of the tension built in the first half. Certain narrative beats feel stretched beyond necessity, momentarily diverting the focus from its visceral horror. However, the final act regains momentum with an over-the-top yet visually striking conclusion that remains consistent with the film's thematic core.

A crucial element is the score by Rob, known for Revenge and Horns, which blends pulsating synth textures with eerie orchestration to amplify the film's unsettling tone. Sound design plays an equally important role, with body horror elements enhanced by grotesquely detailed audio effects that deepen the discomfort.

Despite some pacing missteps, The Substance leaves a lasting impression thanks to its bold concept, meticulous craftsmanship, and Demi Moore's powerhouse performance. A film that, while imperfect, fearlessly explores the darker facets of human identity.

SPOILER ALERT

One of the film's more questionable choices is how effortlessly the protagonist suddenly becomes an expert carpenter, managing to construct a hidden room with a flush-to-wall sliding door in a single day-something that even seasoned professionals would struggle with. This kind of narrative convenience undermines some of the film's otherwise grounded tension, making certain sequences feel unintentionally exaggerated.",6.0,1,2,fear,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9073787927627563}",Positive
The Substance,Great story amazing performance,"The best thing about the film is Demi Moore's performance; she is not afraid of looking old, and reflects the vulnerability and insecurity that comes from body criticism, self-destruction due to feeling inferior over time, and the decline of a career.

The story is novel because of how it is presented, a cloning ritual with its specific rules and processes.

The first trap is to respect the process and its times, the second trap is to believe that promise of a life focused on beauty, glamour, admiration and what is believed to entail.

That great life, experienced personally or vicariously, is false and non-existent, since the motivation is selfish, inconsequential and superficial like the world in which it has been created.

It speaks of the pressure and even violence from and towards women, in the public eye and in their personal lives, who lose the right to be relevant.

The woman trapped in an exact period where only then can you be primarily beautiful and recognized, in the eyes of others and even worse, in her own eyes.

The ending clearly honors classic horror films, Frankenstein, Carrie, The Shining; we go from the imposed standards of beauty and end up with a character that goes beyond old age, from a phenomenon and a monster.

We start with a woman adored, admired and desired for her beauty until she becomes a hated creature, despised and persecuted for being the opposite, and although she clearly says ""It's still me"", it is not enough
The scene in front of the mirror is violent in every sense, exposing the existential voids, the insecurities, the dark side of what is not spoken or forgiven.

The character in her two faces, pursues the same ambition, betraying herself, and hating herself alone or when she faces herself.

The Substance,REMEMBER YOU'RE ONE,"The Substance follows Elizabeth Sparkle, a narcissist who's overly preoccupied with her appearance to a point where she measures her self-worth solely based on how her physical features fit into the ideals of perverted men and sexist and shallow societal standards. The more she ages, the less she's objectived as a borderline sex toy by the production company that hires her and the sexist fanbase who follow her show solely to get either sexual gratification or some unhealthy and irrational contentment from watching her stretch and bend on TV. Elizabeth being a self-obsessed drama queen feels constant hatred towards herself because strangers don't adore her body (not her personality, interests and deeds) anymore. This stupid character of hers drives her into getting involved in a shadowy, back-alley treatment which promises to turn her young again with strict rules she and her other unpredictable and uncaring self must follow. Things spiral out of control and both her and her other young self start pissing off each other, slowly breaking the singularity that was expected from them. The Substance finally instructs it's audience to cherish whatever one posseses and how adoration from strangers is ephemeral and is never to be used as a scale to measure one's sense of worth.

The Substance,Horror ‚ùå Comedy ‚úÖ,"Beginning of the movie is interesting but as the plot unfold it becomes more tense and comedy but I should have to say that this movie portrays contemporary reality of beauty pageant which satisfies more by exposing dark realities. I began with huge expectations although it didn't failed to discourage me as a viewer. So i would suggest watching movie.

I found The Substance to be an interesting watch. The beginning grabs your attention right away, and as the story progresses, it becomes more intense but also adds a touch of comedy. What really impressed me, though, was how the movie tackled the reality of beauty pageants. It doesn't just focus on the glamour but also uncovers the darker, hidden truths, which I think is very relevant to our times.

I started the movie with high expectations, and while it wasn't perfect, it didn't discourage me as a viewer. Overall, I enjoyed it and feel it's a movie worth watching.

The Substance,One of the Best Body Horror Movies of 2024,"""The Substance"" is a deeply unsettling yet profoundly captivating body horror film that has undoubtedly left its mark as one of the most thought-provoking and visually gripping movies of 2024. Directed with a bold vision, the film delves into the dark undercurrents of modern society's obsession with beauty and perfection. What makes it stand out, besides its eerie plot, is the masterful use of practical effects that heighten the horror, giving it a visceral edge that CGI-laden movies often lack. It is not just a movie about body horror; it is a stark reflection of the insecurities and pressures we face in today's image-obsessed world.

From the very beginning, ""The Substance"" hooks the audience with its grotesque yet mesmerizing visuals. The story revolves around a group of individuals, each desperate to attain the ideal appearance. They turn to an experimental product known as ""The Substance,"" a mysterious cosmetic solution that promises to enhance their looks. At first, it seems like a miracle, but the horrifying side effects soon manifest, transforming their bodies in unimaginable ways. The film expertly builds tension as these characters undergo a terrifying metamorphosis, their once-cherished quest for beauty spiraling into a nightmare of physical and mental disintegration.

The practical effects in ""The Substance"" are nothing short of spectacular. Every gory detail, every twisted mutation feels incredibly real. The filmmakers' dedication to using physical prosthetics, makeup, and animatronics to create the film's horrifying transformations is a refreshing throwback to classic horror films of the '80s and '90s. The grotesque alterations to the characters' bodies feel tangible, adding a layer of intensity that makes the audience squirm in their seats. These effects are not just there for shock value; they serve as a visual metaphor for the internal and societal pressures the characters face. As their bodies contort and deform, the film forces the viewer to confront the ugly truth about the lengths people will go to in order to meet society's beauty standards.

However, it's not just the film's practical effects that make ""The Substance"" a standout body horror film. Its story holds up just as well. At its core, the film is a searing critique of modern beauty culture. It reflects the dark reality of a society where everyone is constantly striving to look better, comparing themselves to others and feeling inadequate. The movie examines how these pressures push individuals to extreme measures, leading them to experiment with their bodies in dangerous and often irreversible ways. Whether it's cosmetic surgery, dieting, or using unregulated beauty products, people today are willing to risk it all to fit into an ideal that is often unattainable.

The characters in the film are tragically relatable. Each of them embodies a different aspect of societal pressure: the social media influencer, the aging actress, the fitness model-all trapped in a never-ending cycle of comparison and self-loathing. Rather than appreciating their natural beauty, they become consumed by an unhealthy desire to improve themselves, no matter the cost. ""The Substance"" shines a light on how damaging these societal expectations can be, leading to a collective obsession with perfection that only breeds insecurity and self-hate.

The movie's pacing is also commendable. The slow, creeping dread that builds throughout the film culminates in a horrifying climax that leaves viewers reeling. The steady progression of the characters' physical transformations mirrors their psychological descent, as they slowly lose control of both their bodies and their minds. The tension never lets up, and by the end, ""The Substance"" has succeeded not just in shocking its audience but in making them reflect on their own relationship with beauty and self-worth.

In conclusion, ""The Substance"" is more than just a body horror movie-it is a mirror held up to our society's unhealthy obsession with appearance. The film's blend of stunning practical effects and its incisive commentary on the pressures to conform to beauty standards make it one of the best horror films of 2024. It is a must-watch for horror fans and anyone who has ever felt the crushing weight of societal expectations.

The Substance,The Good The Bad The Ugly,"Substance is a film that immediately pulls you in with its intriguing premise. From the very start, I found myself wondering why I hadn't watched it earlier despite seeing it multiple times on my OSN homepage. The movie builds up its story in a gripping way, making it seem like a thought-provoking thriller rather than just another horror flick.

At its core, Substance carries a powerful message about society's obsession with constantly seeking a better version of oneself, especially in terms of physical appearance. It cleverly explores the dark side of beauty standards, body modifications, and the lengths people go to in pursuit of perfection.

However, midway through, the film takes a drastic turn towards extreme horror. Some of the scenes are so unsettling that I had to look away-something I rarely do. While the violence and gore serve a purpose in reinforcing the movie's message, they can be overwhelming at times. The intensity only escalates as the film progresses, making the final act particularly hard to watch.

Despite the horrific moments, Substance remains a well-crafted and thought-provoking film. It leaves a lasting impact not just because of its shocking imagery but due to the deeper themes it presents.

The Substance,The truth that nobody wants to face,"The Substance is a thought-provoking film that delivers a powerful message about self-acceptance and the natural process of aging. It masterfully explores the consequences of rejecting our true selves in pursuit of unrealistic ideals. The movie highlights how obsessing over youth and comparing ourselves to others can lead to a nightmarish existence, stripping away happiness and authenticity.

What makes The Substance truly impactful is its ability to blend psychological horror with a deeply human message. It doesn't just critique societal beauty standards-it forces the audience to confront their own fears about aging and self-worth. Instead of portraying aging as something to fear, the film redefines it as a beautiful, inevitable part of life that should be embraced rather than resisted.

With gripping performances, a haunting atmosphere, and a message that lingers long after the credits roll, The Substance is more than just a horror film-it's a reflection on identity, self-worth, and the dangers of losing ourselves in the pursuit of perfection.",9.0,3,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9251638054847717}",Positive

The Substance,"A Bold, Dreamlike Experience That Resonates Long After the Credits Roll","It lefts a deep impression on me, mainly because of its directing style, which reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's work. The director's attention to detail is remarkable, and every shot feels perfectly crafted, creating a tense yet beautiful atmosphere. This style gives the film a unique, almost dreamlike quality, similar to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The pacing is slow, but in a way that pulls you in, and the visuals are mesmerizing. The music is also strikingly similar to 2001-it's atmospheric and adds so much to the overall feeling of the film.

Demi Moore's performance is absolutely captivating. I was drawn to the subtlety in her acting, which made her character feel both fragile and powerful at the same time. Both actresses in the movie were impressive. They each added something important to the story, and their performances made the overall cast feel like a tight-knit group.

Overall, Substance is a bold and shocking movie that left me thinking long after it ended.

The Substance is raw, unapologetically original, and drenched in 80s-style bloody horror vibes.

Then, they're quickly discarded, mirroring the short shelf life society imposes on them.

The film leans into body horror with a striking blend of satire and visceral violence, creating a nightmarish reflection of beauty standards, power, and disposability. The music, script, and aesthetic choices add a biting sense of dark humor, making the horror all the more unsettling.

Fargeat delivers a chilling finale that lingers, and Demi Moore is absolutely deserving of her nomination. A fearless, unflinching film that doesn't hand women the power-they just show us the brutal truth of it.

The Substance,Consumerist Society Viewed as a Dantean Hellscape,"To begin, the mise en sc√®ne utilizes color and contrast in a maximalist, though not to say superfluous, way, suggesting that, even with all that consumerist societies have got going for them, they still, so to speak, lack substance. This, we find, is one of their indelible features. The events depicted in the film serve as an externalization of Elizabeth/Sue's (and our own) individual psychology. Using The Substance, a metaphor for self-beautification, intoxication, or industriousness, we brutally contort our identities and very natures to make ourselves commensurable with socialized norms and unattainable expectations. The grotesqueness of each character's body is meant to punctuate the unnaturalness and infecundity of such conformity. The film, though, does not advocate for a Bohemian way of life; rather, it simply wants to suggest that the normative terrain of modern-day consumerist societies is tantamount to a Dantean hellscape, defined by our environment and our choices. In light of this, I feel as though her final manifestation as Monstro Elizabeth/Sue is perhaps most true to herself. Unfortunately, not many of us look past the body in which we find each other and ourselves. Jeff did, though; she just did not trust herself enough at the time to believe him (though, to be fair, Jeff could be a sleaze and we just don't know it yet; what were his intentions exactly?

The Substance,"Brave, provocative and ultimately disappointing","Reviewed by Filmmining 101:

""The Substance"" comes at a very interesting time where humans are increasingly employing any method to make themselves relevant in the public sphere. With an emphasis on superficial appearances, plastic surgeries, digital augmentation, and 24-hour advertisements through social and legacy media, there is no denying that man has lost his appetite for intimacy and acceptance of his own nature. If immortality was readily available, you would be surprised at how many would jump at this opportunity to satisfy their vanity ignoring ethical and moral dilemmas (let alone possible psychological and physiological consequences). As such, ""The Substance"" deals with this aspect through the eyes of a fading Hollywood starlet and director-writer Carolie Fargeat attempts to offer an insightful critique and satire of Hollywood.

Elizabeth Sparkles, a once mighty A-lister, has now faded (according to executives) due to her ageing looks and thus, she should not carry the mantle of a desirable female presenter because people know, deserve and want better. Disregarded and laughed behind her back, no one can disagree with humanity's outrageous beauty standards that apply for women (there are those for men too, a story for a different essay though), especially for those who achieve superstardom. Yet, Elizabeth is guilty herself of perpetuating this vicious system (represented in the film by a superb Dennis Quaid) which chews naive females and spits them out broken after they served their purpose for younger and more outrageous versions. When the substance ""births"" Sue, she is a sassy, demanding and manipulative doll who will do nothing to achieve fame due to her overwhelming beauty and Lolita inspired mannerisms.

Fargeat plays cleverly the tropes here making us believe Elizabeth and Sue are two different people yet they are not. Heavily implied that Elizabeth in her youth (as Sue) would have acted the same way, the script highlights a lot of things under the most minimum of dialogue. On one hand you have a strong critique of a superficial infrastructure which places heavy burden on physical appearance (a magnetic and explosive Margaret Qualley). On the other, while few would have chosen a new life with this gift and make most out of it, Sue goes straight back to this hell-pit, driven by a constant need for approval, adoration and admiration. Coralie's assessments do not mess around, an admirable trait in this age to be able to have this brutal discussion.

The camera lens, itself an artifact for worshipping the god of popularity and desirability represented by the vast quantities of the unknown audience members is placed front and center. Under a Peeping Tom quality, the extreme body closes up of Sue accentuate her physique on purpose resembling modern pornography, while the cold and distant framing of Elizabeth indicates our fascination with a relic of a bygone era. As modern society tends to rewards humans based on a singular element, the script heightens this: either young and beautiful (and nothing else) or old and forgotten (and nothing else). Shooting their respective scenes like two different films, Fargeat reflects this though different editing and visual styles including the use of Raffertie's pendeluming score demonstrating a maturity (and confidence) very few directors possess today. Fargeat's energy is unmatched through a strong production design and audio mix that accentuate Elizabeth's sensory overload in a way not done (or felt) before rendering ""The Substance"" a novel cinematic experience. If Aronofsky, Lynch and Tarantino had a baby together, ""The Substance"" would be the closest thing to it.

Moore excels in a career defining role that could mirror her own experiences; the past sex symbol who got paid extravagant amounts of money to showcase her body (""Striptease"" (1996)), by the early noughties quietly retracted herself from the industry despite a much anticipated villainous take in ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" (2003). With a handful of lines and enough suppressive stoicism, Moore is a force to be reckoned here, giving a fearless performance few American actress would dare to go to resembling the early work of Eva Green (""The Dreamers"" (2003), ""Penny Dreadful"" (2014-2016) or Isabelle Hubert's in ""Elle"" (2016).

However, despite all the good will behind the film and its ambition to tackle several themes, ""The Substance"" becomes overflowing initially with style and in the end mumbles through several underdeveloped layers of psycho-social subjects: ageism, self-loathing, social isolation, superficial relationships, body shaming, fame addiction and more all thrown into a visually arresting and aggressive mix which eventually runs out of steam in a bonkers finale. Unable to maintain her level of confidence, Fargeat loses sight of her original aim by elevating the body horror aspects which although might bear a Cronenberg notion to them to mirror both of these women's experience in the idiolatric arena of TV, they remain unconvincing due to badly done prosthetic effects. The inevitable clash between old and new is swept away for a banal resolution which under different circumstances could have had reached a satisfying catharsis. Aronofsky's work in ""The Wrestler"" (2008) and ""Black Swan"" (2010) tackled similar matters with more grace that Fargeat's efforts here.

For all its well meaning intentions, ""The Substance"" does not know what to do. Is this a story of Elizabeth trying to recapturing her glory days, a strong condemnation of a exploitive-for-women system or a destructive onslaught on society's obsession with beauty? She does not seem certain either and similarly to how Elizabeth's plan turns out, the film elects to hammer its messaging through its bonkers execution which could be the only thing besides Moore's performance that might linger in memory after the credits roll.",4.0,4,6,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.5853647589683533}",EMPTY

The Substance,Grossing people out with a good excuse,"This movie was made very well and technically everything is really excellent, maybe even perfect, but the plot has major problem that causes whole thing to collapse.

Fame is cruel, but forgive me for not having sympathy for the desperation of a temporary lottery winner when the whole rest of the world never was one.

the biggest problem in the story for me is that they in fact ARE NOT ONE. What did Demi get from this deal really? Half the time in a coma, but KNOWING that there is someone out there that fell out of her, and who is what she wants to be? She does not remember what the young whatshername girl did during the week. If they shared memories, that would work much better, but that would also complicate things and the outcome would have to be different.

The Substance,"HIGH CONCEPT IDEA, POOR EXECUTION","HIGH CONCEPT IDEA
POOR EXECUTION.

Some filmmakers like to make their movies entertaining, others well, as a film critic I question if they even put in the effort in to be entertaining at all. The Substance has an amazing concept if you could have a better version of yourself that is younger and perfect. Elisabeth (Demi Moore) was once a very famous movie star and is now downgraded to having her own fitness modeling TV show. But she isn't getting any younger and Harvey (Dennis Quaid) is looking for a new and younger model. Once Elisabeth starts taking a brand new drug which is called, The Substance, it makes her young again, but not in the way audiences who haven't seen this movie yet will think it does. What is weird is she gives her younger self a brand new name, Sue (Margarette Qualley) . The film has a very high concept and an amazing idea, you don't need to be a film critic or a movie buff to see this. Unfortunately the execution of The film The Substance from script to screen is not done properly. The opening is very fluid and flawless and Demi Moore's performance is a gift to all of us at the beginning of the film. But once we get to point where she starts taking the drug, it all turns into a complete mess and becomes very bizarre and freaky. In one instance there's a prosthetic and makeup effect that made me think of Moore as a horror version of The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. I could see at the same time though that writer and director Coralie Fargeat did do some talent with the directing part. She knew how she wanted the film to look. The imagery is very satisfactory, and she does a great job with painting each scene as far as the cinematography goes. She also lights up each scene beautifully. But the bad part comes with the bizarre content she added. A body coming out of another body for an example and so on. In one scene to describe this better, when Elisabeth first takes The Substance she drops to the floor and twitches. Then she has her newer, better and younger version of herself, Sue emerge from the back of her body, in which Sue has to stitch Elisabeth up afterwards and attach a feeding tube to her. This movie is supposed to make you wonder if you would take a drug like this if it was real. But I for one couldn't concentrate on that, because of all of the bizarreness going on within the movie. By the time we get to the middle of the film I found myself laughing and that was not a good thing because this is supposed to be a serious movie. I still struggle to understand how this movie is winning awards. I can compare the ending of this movie to Everything Everywhere All At Once. I was very disappointed how this movie failed to succeed in my eyes after it had a great beginning. The only people who think this movie is good, are those who want to see Demi Moore naked, and those people need help.

Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are both very good and the confrontational visuals, from grotesque wide-angle close-ups, thru uncompromising nudity, to the Junji-Ito-worthy body horror are genuinely exciting and fun.

In fact, until the trolley left the tracks at the 100 minute mark, I absolutely loved this movie. Then incredulously the story becomes an inconsistent, incoherent mess, undoing all the great storytelling up to that point.

For the next 40 minutes or so, the movie is just offensively bad with almost nothing to recommend it, making no final, insightful statement about beauty or obsession, or ending with a clever, savage twist, but instead leaning on horror cliche and spectacle to see us out in a frankly ludicrous final scene that will make sense to pretty much no one.

Arcadian,Decent horror/drama,"Monster movies are my comfort genre. I have watched more than I care to admit, covering the whole gamut from great to garbage. Arcadian falls somewhere in the middle of this, along the ""passable"" range.

This minimalist horror/family drama has solid performances, a few unsettling moments, an interesting score which goes against genre conventions with some haunting piano tracks.

A small family struggles to survive in a post-apocalyptic countryside where monsters roam by night and besiege their farm, Minecraft/Terraria-style.

There's the soulful father (Nicolas Cage); the nerdy introverted son (Jaeden Martell), who is a thinker and a planner; and the impulsive, emotional son (Maxwell Jenkins), who has a crush on a girl living in a nearby community of survivors and keeps visiting her in spite of the danger.

Arcadian has some genuinely spooky moments. There is a creepy scene where a monster extends a clawed arm to an impossible length to try and grab a sleeping victim. The film needed more of that and less shaky-cam in pitch black, of which there is quite a lot.

Speaking of the monsters, as a fan of creatures with original designs I thought these critters were not bad. They look like demonic, oversized versions of Sid from the Ice Age and have this weird, gangly way of moving which turns into sudden bursts of speed. It's quite unsettling.

Unfortunately, in the last act this goes too far and the monsters pursue the heroes performing some kind of circus number, which looks absolutely laughable. I won't describe it, because if you have watched Arcadian you know what I am talking about, and if you haven't you would think I am crazy.

But yeah, they perform some kind of circus number. It's supposed to look creepy and alien but I was howling with laughter, which is not what you want in the climax of your monster movie. It reminded me of the Simpsons episode where circus performers try to escape a storm by forming a giant human kite.

Arcadian,Strength and Weakness,"""Arcadian"" is a 2024 post-apocalyptic horror film that follows a father and his two sons struggling to survive in a world overrun by nocturnal creatures. Directed by Benjamin Brewer, the film stars Nicolas Cage in a grounded and surprisingly subdued performance.

Plot Summary
Set in a desolate future, the film centers around Paul (Cage), a father determined to protect his sons, Lucas and Thomas, from the dangers of the outside world. During the day, they live a relatively normal life within the confines of their fortified home, but as night falls, they must retreat indoors to avoid the monstrous creatures that emerge from the darkness. When Paul is attacked and severely injured, the boys must step up and use their father's teachings to ensure their survival.

Strengths
* Atmospheric World-Building: The film effectively establishes a bleak and desolate post-apocalyptic world. The decaying environment and the constant threat of the unknown create a palpable sense of dread.

* Character Dynamics: The relationships between the father and his sons are well-developed, providing emotional depth to the story. Cage delivers a nuanced performance, showcasing a vulnerable and protective side to his character.

* Suspenseful Thriller Elements: The film effectively builds suspense, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as the family faces increasing danger.

Weaknesses
* Familiar Premise: The basic premise of the film - a family fighting for survival against unseen threats - has been explored in numerous other films, such as ""A Quiet Place.""
* Lack of Originality: The film doesn't offer any groundbreaking ideas or unique perspectives on the post-apocalyptic genre.

* Creature Design: While effective in creating a sense of fear, the creatures themselves are not particularly original or visually striking.

Overall
""Arcadian"" is a competent but ultimately predictable post-apocalyptic thriller. While it doesn't break any new ground, the film delivers solid performances, effective suspense, and a well-realized atmosphere. Fans of the genre will likely find it enjoyable, but those seeking originality may be left wanting more.",5.0,0,0,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7870011925697327}",EMPTY

Atlas,"I was expecting a far worse movie, but I was entertained","Seeing Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez pop up on Netflix doesn't necessarily leave you with a lot of hope that it's going to be a good movie, but I surprisingly liked it much more than I expected.

It may not start off particularly strong, but it gets going and I feel Jennifer Lopez did a better job acting than I expected, and I do remember her doing fairly well at times, like in Out of Sight.

Anyway, it really gets going after about 20-30 minutes, and the action is very well done in my opinion and fun to watch. Think Halo but even more action at it's best. She doesn't trust AI but slowly learns to trust the AI she is forced to work with and develops a bond that grows throughout, and I enjoyed that.

I think many Netflix movies get unfairly rated poorly and of course anything starring JLo will as well. As usual, it wouldn't surprise me if the very low ratings came from people who didn't even watch it. I really don't feel if I was going to give something a 4 or lower, I would even continuing watching it and didn't feel I could give a fair review (unless I was in a theater with friends or family and had to sit through a movie I hated).

Atlas,barely watchable,"Greetings again from the darkness. My goal is to give every movie a fair shake, and to seek out the best elements even when a film disappoints. I don't recall a time when this goal has been more difficult to achieve than after watching this latest from director Brad Peyton (San Andreas, 2015) and co-writers Leo Sardarian (""StartUp""), Aron Eli Coleite (""Locke & Key"").

Jennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant government analyst and expert on AI, especially on Harlan (Simu Liu, BARBIE), ominously deemed the world's first AI terrorist. We know Atlas is smart because she has a chess winning streak against the computer and she wears black frame eyeglasses. After an opening which features Earth in peril, we flash forward 28 years, where it's evolved into ""good AI"" versus ""evil AI"". Don't worry, Atlas is on the side of good, despite her constantly frazzled state (with perfect hair) and the personal (emotional) baggage she carries with her.

After years of searching, Atlas discovers the location for Harlan, and General Boothe (Mark Strong, character actor extraordinaire) forms a team led by Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K Brown, AMERICAN FICTION, 2023) to capture Harlan so his CPU can be studied. Of course, the mission doesn't go as planned and by the end, I was wondering which racked up the most points: explosions or Ms. Lopez's cringy acting moments. Terrible punchlines regarding a running coffee gag placed third in the competition. Since I admittedly search for positives in every movie, let's go with Simu Liu's unusual blue-eyed effect, the tight pants on Agent Atlas, and giant robotics that look like the one that went rogue in ROBOCOP (37 years ago). Apologies, but that's the best I can do for this one, other than to say we have an early Razzie frontrunner.

Atlas,Better than Expected.,"PROS
I thought the special effects and future technology were great. (I personally love that stuff.)

The action was good.

The basic message and story were good.

Overall entertaining except for anybody looking to criticize, ridicule and condemn anything and everything.

CONS
Jennifer Lopez over acted a lot of the time. Suggesting that her character, supposedly in her 30s, was too immature and simple minded for someone who was supposed to be a leading expert in AI and technology.

Dialogue and story were corny sometimes.

Another movie about AI going rogue, with a ""Thanos from the Avengers"" goal of saving humanity and mother nature, by wiping out a large portion of the human population.

MINOR KNITPICKY COMPLAINTS
They said in the beginning of the movie that the planet the humans had to attack the rogue AI on, had a toxic atmosphere. To borrow a line from Pitch Meeting, ""I believe they forgot about that rule"" towards the end of the movie.

I personally found it hard to believe the Jennifer Lopez character would be on the attack ship, be a leading expert on AI and technology, but not be at all familiarized with the robotic military suits the soldiers were going to wear to attack the rogue AI.

I honestly was not expecting much being that I had heard nothing about this movie, it was on Netflix, and Jennifer Lopez was the star. I just clicked on it out of curiosity and boredom, fully prepared to click off and watch anything else. It was not the greatest action scifi movie I've ever seen.

Atlas,Give it a few minutes,"So after just recently finishing the film, I have to say the development of character cohesion and a bond that one could say they saw a mile away, it still surpassed my expectation by allowing one to surpass their deepest fear and allow a bond to form despite her tragic family background loss due to what one could only entitle as the singularity. If you allow the first 15 minutes to pass and ignore the very very very common theme of a rogue A. I driven by his goal to help humanity survive through genocide, you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by what the film actually offers. Yes, one could easily argue the protagonist should have been cast differently, as I am not a fan JL0 at all. I found myself entertained and found myself surprised that she gave an overall good performance. For me it was the common feeling of distrust she shares with humanity of constantly being let down and her very tragic upbringing, trust in any life form is something anyone would expect not to develop. I won't ruin the film for you, but the bond between her and her new A.

Atlas,Do you need the definition of a &$?@!% cake?,"First of all, though the average rating of this film is middle of the road, I think action fans are going to be entertained quite a bit more. There is a lot of ""Terminator"", a good helping of ""The Matrix"" and a sprinkling of ""Starship Troopers"" in this film but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There have just been too many movies made by now and 100% originality is almost unattainable.

That being said Atlas does struggle to make its own mark among the sci-fi classics it draws from. The beginning is rushed, as is common in action films, to get to said action and character development suffers. The special effects are absolutely delicious. I was interested in this movie because it is in part a chamber piece and I was curious if J-Lo has the chops to pull it off. She does just fine in that regard.

Atlas,A solid sci-fi that explores more than a strange new world...,"At first glance, Atlas is a slick sci-fi action. We learn within the first few minutes of the film that Earth's population took a pounding after an AI uprising, but has since become a technologically advanced civilisation, capable of faster-than-light travel, united in defending itself from rogue AI on a planetary scale.

After obtaining the whereabouts of the android behind the deadly uprising decades previously, an elite troupe of soldiers and their advanced military hardware head off-world on a mission to bring him to justice...

Had Atlas let this simply play out, we would have seen Jennifer Lopez accomplish little more than a weird remake of Aliens. As it is though, the film invests heavily in the exploring the interactional boundaries of artificial intelligence and the repercussions/impacts as they pertain to trust.

I was very impressed with the way the story, the director and Jennifer Lopez dealt with this.

Story (as it pertains to AI):
A number of issues are explored, including; Can AI be trusted? To what extent? Is a kind of symbiosis between human and artificial intelligence sometimes necessary? Is the mutual trust necessary for a 'Ranger' to harmonise with their military tech a step our leading actor is willing to take, especially when considering her past AI experiences...?

Director:
Creating a sci-fi that successfully balances hi-tech action with serious themes (we might have to deal with in the near future) is no easy task. The director not only manages this with bravado, but also draws a top-notch performance from Jennifer Lopez to help pull it off.

Jennifer Lopez:
I have to admit, I can't remember having seen anything with JL that I found bad. In fact, be it a romantic comedy, or a self-justice flick, I think she always does a pretty good job convincing me of her role. This is the first time her acting has really impressed me though, despite the genre not being considered typical for tickling the most out of actors. I found the mutual trust issues as they pertain to AI very interesting, and exploring them convincingly is a credit to Jennifer Lopez.

To sum up, the CGI is top, the characters aren't ridiculous or annoying as they so often seem to be in sci-fis, the story was solid and very well executed.

The logic gaps are obvious, wherein, in a situation where an AI is capable of thinking on its own, and influence and reprogram other AI's, flees from the planet, and the planet goes back to making extensive use of AI.

The story progresses in a terribly stereotypical manner, in which almost all except the protagonist are dead on the mission, and only in such a situation will she have to do what she has not done since long.

Unnecessary time wasted on cringe communication and the typical angry lashes of protagonist at the AI.

Atlas,Atlas,"""Atlas,"" directed by Brad Peyton and starring Jennifer Lopez, is a 2024 Netflix sci-fi thriller that ventures into the intricate relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence. Lopez portrays Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant but reclusive data analyst deeply skeptical of AI.

The film's visual and thematic inspiration draws heavily from a range of sci-fi influences. Peyton, known for action-packed films like ""San Andreas"" and ""Rampage,"" combines elements from ""Titanfall"" and ""Cast Away,"" creating a unique sci-fi landscape that feels both familiar and fresh. The movie opens with an adrenaline-fueled sequence showcasing futuristic technology and the high stakes involved in Atlas's mission.

Lopez's performance as Atlas is central to the film's impact. Her character is initially portrayed as emotionally detached, her distrust of AI stemming from a traumatic past event that the movie gradually unveils. This backstory adds depth to her character, making her journey of reluctantly partnering with AI to save humanity more compelling. Lopez brings a nuanced portrayal to the role, balancing the character's toughness with moments of vulnerability and growth.

The supporting cast includes Simu Liu, Sterling K. Brown, Lana Parrilla, and Mark Strong, each contributing to the film's dynamic ensemble. Liu plays a fellow team member who brings a contrasting optimism to Atlas's skepticism, while Brown and Parrilla provide additional layers of intrigue and tension. Strong's portrayal of the enigmatic antagonist adds to the film's suspense, his motives intertwined with the broader themes of AI and control.

""Atlas"" explores significant philosophical questions about technology's role in society. The film delves into the ethical implications of AI, the potential for coexistence, and the fear of technological overreach. Peyton uses the sci-fi genre not just for spectacle but to provoke thought on these timely issues. The narrative is well-paced, balancing action sequences with moments of introspection, allowing the audience to reflect on the deeper messages embedded within the plot.

The film's production design deserves special mention, with its futuristic settings and high-tech gadgets effectively immersing the audience in its world. The visual effects are top-notch, particularly in scenes involving advanced robotics and space exploration. These elements are complemented by a moody, atmospheric score that heightens the tension and emotional resonance of key scenes.

However, ""Atlas"" is not without its flaws. Some critics point out that the storyline occasionally falls into familiar sci-fi tropes, and certain plot twists can be predictable. Additionally, while the film's ambition is commendable, it sometimes struggles to balance its action-packed sequences with the deeper philosophical questions it raises, leading to moments where the pacing feels uneven.

Despite these minor criticisms, ""Atlas"" stands out as a thought-provoking entry in the sci-fi genre. Its blend of action, emotional depth, and thematic exploration of AI's role in humanity's future offers a compelling viewing experience. Lopez's strong performance anchors the film, supported by a talented cast and impressive production values. For fans of sci-fi and those interested in the ethical dimensions of technology, ""Atlas"" provides both entertainment and a platform for reflection.

Overall, ""Atlas"" is a well-executed sci-fi thriller that succeeds in delivering both spectacle and substance, making it a notable addition to Netflix's original film catalog in 2024.",9.0,11,19,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'technology', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'scene', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8898160457611084}",Positive
Atlas,Good effects in a mediocre film,"This film is a visual treat. The CGI is top notch and makes for an interesting spectacle at first but the plot then takes over rather quickly in making you realise what a dull movie this truely is.

JLo's character is all over the place. At one point she's a very intelligent and collected expert in all things AI - able to interrogate a captured unit and extract information. Later in the film her becomes and emotional and quite irrational wreck of a character that operates the Smith unit with all the grace and fineness of your 80 year old grandmother. This film would have been greatly improved if the JLo character could have settled on one personality.

The Smith unit is equally frustrating in that it's practically indestructible until it's suddenly not. It is almost hilarious how it seems to contain fittings and features for every outcome, including fixing a broken leg. It's like a something from an 80's kids cartoon.

Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,As Delightfully Captivating As It Is Endlessly Endearing,"The 2nd feature-length film in the famed Wallace & Gromit series, Vengeance Most Fowl marks the return of the definitive screen villain of our age whose evil perfection is only matched by his cold dead expressionless beady eyes, and is a masterwork of top-notch storytelling & first-rate craftsmanship that brims with as much creativity & imagination as it does with heartfelt charm.

Directed by Nick Park & Merlin Crossingham, the premise is simple & straightforward like before and is crafted with the same zest, soul & passion as their earlier works. The story takes a dig at our over-reliance on technology but in a gentle, amusing fashion, and it is at its most interesting when featuring the evil penguin concocting his revenge on the eccentric inventor & his loyal dog.

Still, there are a few empty stretches in the narrative as there isn't enough material in the script to properly cover its 79 mins runtime, and the picture as a whole would've sufficed as a shorter, tightly-knitted & more compact adventure. The wonderful wit & simplicity in execution does aid the experience, and the claymation on display leaves a lasting imprint of its own with clever set pieces.

Overall, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is yet another fascinating entry in the franchise that's as delightfully captivating as it is endlessly endearing. Despite the film not scoring as high as Aardman Animations' finest examples, there is a pleasant quality & universal appeal to it that inspires affection & exudes comfort throughout, thus making it one of the most fun & wholesome offerings of the year.",,1,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'technology', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9503509402275085}",Positive
Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,Charmless nostalgia-bait,"I wanted to love this. It feels sacrilege to criticise something as culturally precious to us Brits as Wallace & Gromit, but given the astronomical standards set by Park & co, I have to be a dissenting voice here amid the glowing praise.

This felt like a charmless facsimile of W&G, a fan-made production where everything just felt a bit off - IMO not helped by the passing of Peter Sallis, who is replaced with Ben Whitehead's accurate but soulless Sallis impression.

That's not to denigrate the incredible craft and skill involved in making a film like this, it all looks great. Almost too great.

The problem however lies in the script, the story, and the bizarre dearth of any of the warmth or 'detail' we've come to expect from Aardman.

Anton Deck? Onya Doorstep? Up North News? Come on guys. This is first-draft energy. This is not funny or clever enough to be worthy of an Aardman production. It has the cadence of being funny without being at all funny.

The jokes - of which there are few - all fall flat, with an almost desperate overreliance on slapstick to compensate for this.

Also, did Park and co just lift the main plot driver straight out of that evil Krusty doll episode of Treehouse of Horror?

The whole story and plot feels unusually generic, like they're just going through the motions & phoning it in. At best it feels like a lazy rehash of the same formula we've seen many times before. At worst, this is a cynical nostalgia-bait corporate cash-grab that feels like it was written by one of the film's gnomes.

I hate that I am writing this, but I was just so underwhelmed and disappointed. And on Christmas Day, no less.

Dune: Part Two,Excellent Visuals but Overly Condensed,"This movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades. The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.

That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.

Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does.

And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.

Dune: Part Two,"What happened? Loved the first, ehhh on the second","I loved the first movie. What happened with the second? For those who read the books.

First, what happened to the Space Guild Navigators? One of the main plots is that the Space Guild Navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems. No where to be found in this movie. So, for those who didn't read the books. Spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie. You have no sense of urgency because if the ""Spice must flow"" is stopped. It's the end of the empire.

Second, what a waste of of Christopher Walken. He comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses. The urgency for the emperor going to Dune is because he doesn't want Paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal? WHAT? I guess since you didn't bring in the Space Guild Navigators you had to invent another reason? Did Christopher's contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes? At the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set. What was also missing was the pressure by the Witches and the Space Guild on the emperor to continue with spice production. Christopher was less menacing and more like 'Grandpa' needs to go to the memory care facility.

Third, I knew the movie was in trouble when I looked at my watch and realized ""There's only nine minutes left in this move, how are they going to end it?"". I felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short. Chaotic in not a good way. There is a whole scene about 'the atomics' that made me question on why is it in the movie? We are told about the 'atomics', but there is no follow-up to the ending battle. The fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps. The ending seemed way to rushed. It's less about a powerful emperor and more like 'how did none of the other houses not take him out?'.

There are other problems that are pretty minor, like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems. Like the Mentat's or the planet of machines. Too much time spent on 'Fade' killing people in an Arena, but failing to mention who these characters are. If you hadn't seen the first film, there deaths make no sense. Robands death seemed like an after thought. Like we need to get rid of this character, but the movie is going on too long. But, my primary complaint is the lack of 'Space Guild Navigators"" and why Spice is so important to these people.

Dune: Part Two,Absolutely outstanding!,"I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events.

His 'Blade Runner 2049' was also gorgeous, but it suffered from being cold, soulless and without any real sense of purpose. Unlike the latter, 'Dune: Part Two' has a purpose (thanks to whatever is left here from Frank Herbert's vision), but it also lacks any semblance of emotion or genuine humanity. It somehow manages to be both epic and flat. Quite a feat, but not one to be proud of.

The film is also tragically miscast. Timoth√©e Chalamet finally starts to rise to the occasion in fits and starts once he becomes ""the one"", but everyone besides Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem are just dreadful. Enough can't be said about how awful Zendaya is here. Even in her wheelhouse she has the range of a spitball, but she's in way, way over her skis on this one. And don't get me started on Christopher Walken as the Emperor. Christopher Walken?! Are you kidding me! This needed an actor with some gravitas and regality. Walken feels far too contemporary for this sort of thing.

Look, 'Dune' is my favorite novel of all-time, and my cool reaction to the first part of this adaptation is why it took me nearly six months to watch this. It's not the changes that bother me, save for the ending with Chani, which is an unforgivable sin in my opinion. It's that this whole thing ends up feeling like a pretentious, preening bore instead of the grand spectacle space opera it should have been.",6.0,6,6,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7443610429763794}",EMPTY
Dune: Part Two,A good book that loses something in this movie.,"I've read the original book several times, and have seen the '84 movie (both versions) and the SyFy channel miniseries. While both missed something, it wasn't as bad as accelerating the timeliness and leaving out key scenes that would make a third movie, Dune Messiah, more plausible. Such as in previous versions Alia, Paul's sister, was the one to kill Vladimir Harkonen. This is what lead to her eventual insanity, as was shown in the SyFy channel's Children of Dune. The cinematography of the movie was great, but splitting the Fremen like how Islam is split was a poor choice. The choice to make the Fremen of two sects might have been a good way to go given how religious sects go, but in MY opinion it was the wrong way to go. And making Paul and even more reluctant hero also weakened the movie. The quickening of the timeliness was foolish because in the book and previous versions, it took time for Paul to learn what he needed to learn and for the love between Paul and Chani to develop.

Dune: Part Two,Unparalleled Epic Visual Extravaganza,"Dune Part 2 is a breathtaking visual extravaganza that not only provides the next chapter in the Dune Universe but also takes you on a spiritual journey. The film begins where the last film left off,We see Paul and his Mother Lady Jessica integrate within the culture of Fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the Fremen are explained seamlessly. They have their own language,their religion and prophecies,the way they value and preserve water is also explained. The cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as Paul Atreides accepts his place as the Messiah while Lady Jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the Fremen because of her Bene Gesserit past. Javier Bardem and Zendaya get to shine as Stilgar and Chani respectively. Stilgar's belief in the prophecy and it's implications is conveyed exceptionally by Mr Bardem while Zendaya does a great job as Chani a brave fremen soldier who loves Paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy. Austin Butler as Feud Ratha stands out immensely. He is ferocious, blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story. The cinematography in this movie by Greg Frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible. This film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen. This film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments. The score by Hans Zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when Paul ascends and take his place as the Lisan-Al Ghaib.

There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate.

Dune: Part Two,Best Movie,"Dune,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, stands as a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, epitomizing the perfect fusion of visionary storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and captivating performances. As the second installment in Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga, ""Dune 2"" surpasses its predecessor in every aspect, solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating.

One of the most striking elements of ""Dune 2"" is its visual prowess. From the barren landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe. Cinematographer Greig Fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet, using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe. The visual effects, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhance the film's otherworldly atmosphere, transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangible.

However, ""Dune 2"" is not merely a feast for the eyes; it is also a triumph of storytelling. Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of Herbert's novel, distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience. The film's pacing is expertly calibrated, allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension. Each scene is imbued with meaning, contributing to the overarching themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.

Central to the film's success are the performances of its ensemble cast. Timoth√©e Chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as Paul Atreides, the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy. Chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role, embodying Paul's internal struggle with grace and nuance. Opposite him, Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother torn between duty and love. Ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity, elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fiction.

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Oscar Isaac commands the screen as Duke Leto Atreides, projecting authority and compassion in equal measure. Zendaya captivates as Chani, the mysterious Fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict. Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem round out the ensemble, delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the film's ensemble.

Beyond its technical and narrative achievements, ""Dune 2"" is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry. At its core, the film grapples with timeless questions about power, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through Paul's journey, we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership. Villeneuve deftly explores these themes, challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and values.

In addition to its thematic richness, ""Dune 2"" is a masterclass in world-building. Villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought Herbert's universe to life, from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions. Every detail, from the costumes to the set design, is thoughtfully crafted to immerse the audience in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants. The result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything they've ever seen before.

In conclusion, ""Dune 2"" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerhouse performances, it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic. Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve. ""Dune 2"" is not just a film; it's an experience-one that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come.",10.0,4,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9800239205360413}",Positive

Dune: Part Two,Good movie but with a rushed script.,"I will keep it short just like the Harkonnen's in this movie. In the first one we saw their power and in the second one it felt like it was brushed off quickly. Like out of nowhere they beat them so easy and quickly. The movie in the beginning gave me the feeling that the cousin of the Baron was going to be this biggest "" bad guy "" where he will do such big evil things and be a big challenge for Paul. Which clearly he was not, and wasn't shown often. Even the Baron and Rabban was not shown often, expected more, they died too quickly and too easy. And I don't know if they had to keep the movie short, but I felt like they should have put more power and time in to the main characters. It went by way too fast in my opinion. Like they were in a rush. The first movie was nice and slow, intense and beautiful scenes. This one felt like a quickie. Paul received super powers immediately and had the emperor on his knees. An emperor which we barely saw, only had a few scenes we can count on one hand. Also at the end I expected a tougher battle, an emperor showing up with a few hundreds of soldiers, didn't make any sense, was so easy overthrown. They could have make it more exciting. I mean it wasn't a bad movie. It was enjoyable just very fast. They should have put at least half an hour or more in the film. And take their time with the characters, Paul's mother, the emperor, the Harkonnen's maybe some epic lines that Paul's father said in the previous one. More dialogue at the end.

The only character in Villeneuve's take on Dune I liked was Jason Momoa's incarnation of Duncan in Part 1.

Dune: Part Two,Disappointment,"Massive disappointment. I know the book a little and I knew where the story was going, but the outcome is worse than I expected. I liked the first film, its grandiose settings, its open questions. The way the second responds is quite appalling.

That the Emperor's throne comes down to a knife fight is already hard to swallow, but what's more, it ends with the good old trick of 'it's the hero who is dead, ah no it's the other one', already seen a million times in film, it's disappointing...

Aesthetically, the story immensely reduces the ambitions of this second part by focusing on the Fremens and their rough desert settings. With the exception of a scene on the Harkonnen planet, Giedi Prime, which is rather impressive in martial white and black tones. That said, I still miss David Lynch's crazy and disgusting Harkonnen with their strange greenish/industrial planet and sexual perversions.

Here we are in a demonstration of pure force, strangely contradicted by the ridiculous fear suddenly displayed by Rabban, and by an astonishing vulnerability of the Harkonnen troops like the Sardaukars to the guerrilla techniques of the Fremens without this being convincingly justified by the mise-en-scene.

We can only imagine that what makes the difference is the infinitely superior number of the Fremen, greatly underestimated by the Harkonnen, which allows them to gain the upper hand at the cost of a major human sacrifice. But this quasi-genocidal aspect is only evoked by a film which obviously must be easy on the general public to be profitable.

Dune: Part Two,A narrative and audiovisual triumph,"I didn't fully connect with the Dune universe until yesterday.

The 80's version, despite being directed by David Lynch, is a fiasco in every way.

And the first of this saga by Villeneuve did not move me enough. I felt it was lukewarm for the beginning of an interplanetary epic.

This second part corrects all the shortcomings of the previous one and is a firm and notable step that positions the saga with the potential to become something similar to what The Lord of the Rings saga achieved.

Denis Villenueve uses the concepts of the book: The Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell with mastery and narrative eloquence:
The twelve stages of the hero's journey
1. Ordinary world. The real world before the story begins.

2. The call to adventure. The protagonist is presented with a problem, challenge or adventure.

3. Call rejection. Fear of change causes reluctance to accept the call, a refusal to leave the comfort zone.

4. Meeting with a mentor with supernatural help. The hero finds support that provides him with information and trains him to respond to the challenge.

5. First threshold. The ordinary world is abandoned and the threshold is crossed into the special or magical world. The hero faces what is known as the desert crossing.

6. Tests, allies and enemies. The hero encounters all kinds of trials, enemies and allies, which allows him to learn the rules of that special world.

7. Approach. The hero overcomes the tests on his path.

8. Decisive evidence. The most critical moment takes place, a life or death test.

9. Reward. The hero has faced death and overcome the fear of it, then comes the reward.

10. The way back. The protagonist has to return to the ordinary world.

11. Resurrection or Enlightenment. On the way back, another decisive test takes place on his home world, the hero once again faces death using everything he has learned. The transformation is complete.

12. Return with the elixir. The hero becomes aware of the acquired knowledge (power) that he uses to help others in the ordinary world.

It is a paradigm that has served many visionaries as a practical guide to create their alternative universes. George Lucas has mentioned on several occasions how valuable reading Campbell was to him in laying the foundation for Star Wars.

Dune 2 is visually majestic. There are memorable scenes: the giant worm cavalcades through the desert are innovative and peculiar. He knows how to take advantage of the immensity of the desert, the enigmatic nature of these extensive desert territories. The arid environment helps to understand the psychology of the characters; like Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a leader with unwavering faith.

The narrative has strong religious connotations: it speaks of a Messiah, of prophecies, of mystical rituals that lead to the knowledge of profound truth, of religious fundamentalism. At the same time and inherent to any power struggle, subtle political intrigue is handled to strengthen positions and implement military strategies.

All these aspects are masterfully brought together. A film of almost three hours that does not falter at any time. On the contrary, as it progresses, interest increases and narrative cohesion grows.

A wonderful cast: Timothe√© Chamalet as Paul Atreides, the son of an important house banished by circumstances and who, in adversity, finds the clarity and inner strength to become a leader and a kind of messiah. Rebecca Ferguson, as Jessica, his mother, who becomes a spiritual leader known as Reverend Mother.

Florence Pugh, as Princess Irulan, who will witness the collapse of the power of her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken). That is to say, all the characters are attractive and well drawn. They feel organic and do not merely represent archetypes.

Everything works fine here. The audiovisual gear provides spectacle with strong foundations supported by a deep story that makes allegories to religious and socio-political problems current in the 21st century.",10.0,3,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8753060102462769}",Positive

It's basically a re-make of 'The Life of Brian' with Paul as Brian and Chani as Brian's mother (""he's not the messiah, he's a really naughty boy"").

At it's heart the book is about not believing in messianic leaders. I think Villeneuve has done an incredible job of what was believed to be a book that was impossible to be translated into film.

At it's heart he uses the Chani character to seed doubt of Paul's godlike leadership.

Dune: Part Two,An Epic Journey: DUNE Deserves Every Ounce of Praise,"Usually, before watching movies, I always visit the IMDB website, check out the ratings, and then if a movie has a rating of 7 or above, I give it a go. That's pretty much my routine with IMDB. But today, this movie has compelled me to take out some special time to come here and those who have made this movie ""DUNE"" deserve all the praise. Everyone who has watched this movie should genuinely rate it from their hearts. I wish IMDB could rate out of 100 so I could give this movie 100 out of 100, but here, the rating only goes up to a maximum of 10. I wish I could personally thank the writers, producers, directors, and every person involved in making this movie.

What a fantastic movie, buddy! I had goosebumps throughout the movie. The story buildup in the first part was amazing, and now, in this second part, the directors and everyone involved have taken it to a whole new level. I've come specifically to rate this movie on IMDB. There are very few movies I've ever rated, but this movie truly deserves nothing but positive ratings from every single person in the world. I can't understand some reviews where people have given it a 7 rating, saying that the plot or maybe the dialogue wasn't up to the mark. I can confidently say that those people just don't appreciate good movies.

Anyone who watches this movie will only have words of praise. There's no doubt about its epic-ness. I am absolutely speechless, and this movie is the biggest and most epic movie of my life. I'm grateful that I've seen it, and I'll definitely watch all its sequels.",10.0,3,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'director', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9676965475082397}",Positive
Dune: Part Two,A truly joyful theater going experience,"This movie made me so, so happy. From the first moment the Harkonnen forces levitated until the credits rolled I could not stop smiling. The _sounds_ of this movie are so physical, the effects all have so much weight, and the cinematography! This film had everything wonderful about Part 1 but added the Dune weird-ness I felt was missing. I am completely convinced this was the correct way to tell this story. Part 1 teaches viewers the world, Part 2 _is_ Dune.

I will say a large chunk of story I had attributed to 'Dune' in my memory is actually from 'Messiah', but that only makes me more excited for the third film (and gives me time to re-read some wonderful science fiction while I wait!)

Dune: Part Two,Separate the book and the movie(s),"Movie's pretty but that's about it - few scifi book adaptations have been successful and after part One I was very hopeful and looking forward to it. After all I read first 3 books at the ripe age of 13 when preparing to host the larp game, so we had to study the characters and the politics of the book veeery thoroughly.

Movie is ok but this part is about a very difficult journey to finally making an 'informed' decision to become the complete Muad D'ib etc. Accepting the fate while his mom breaks the rules of Benet Gesserit by messing with sacred knowledge and substance, at the same time everybody playing their own game and royals caught in the web of intrigues - after all, the movie reduced all these complex plots to a few breathtaking fighting and desert scenes and duels and leaves you wanting to separate the movie and the book. Or, just read the book to relate to the main (?) hero and his journey - it's worth it!

Well I guess the real question is a an unsolvable mystery of the answer to the question: Who is the real hero?",7.0,2,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.6141249537467957}",EMPTY
Dune: Part Two,Epic novel--epic adaptation,"Since the first part of Dune (2021), Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson-about as tough a lady as ever depicted besides Lady Macbeth) join the native tribe of Fremen
on sandy planet Arrakis after being clobbered by the family of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). We know more than ambition is involved, viz., spice, a mind-opening drug and fuel (damn good stuff, I'd guess).

The Freman leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem-always room for more of his talent), believes Paul is their Messiah to defeat the Harkonnen and their eventual new leader, Feyed (Austin Butler, sans hair and guitar but with a very bald head and bloody cudgel). Paul readily assimilates with Fremen and totally assimilates with Freman Chani (Zendaya),

Paul may be an outsider, but then so was Christ, except that Paul (and Biblical Paul) is reluctant and Christ not so much. With romance developing between Paul and Chani, the allusion to Christ steps aside except for those who think there's more to the Jesus and Mary Magdalene friendship. Anyway, it's classic salvation by an outsider ( consider, if you will, the US and Vietnam).

The special effects are what makes this epic film about as beautiful as any you will ever see, which includes riding monstrous worms and a tank bigger and more nimble than any you have ever seen. While the landscape has an inherent greyness much of the time, director Dennis Villeneuve invites comparison to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia from the blistering landscapes to the blue eyes. Even the worm's magic elixir is arrestingly blue.

The conflicting interests go beyond Arrakis as Emperor Shaddam IV (underused Christopher Walken) and his hip daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), involve themselves in the dynamic and dangerous political scene. As for the Spice, the Harkonnen clan have already begun renewing production while Fremen want the opposite- a hot mess.

Dune: Part Two,Dune 2 review,"The film Dune 2 practically begins where the first one ended. Therefore, before watching the second part, it's worth refreshing our memory with Dune 1.

The creators of the film tried to stay as faithful to the original material as possible, but due to the limitations of the cinematic format, they had to omit some important parts of the book and even certain characters. We will only see Jessica and Leto Atreides daughter as an embryo in her mother's womb. Consequently, we won't witness the crucial conversation between Alia, the Baron, and the Emperor. Additionally, the Mentat Hawat is absent in the second part, and Piter De Vries makes only a brief appearance. The time span from Duke Leto Atreides' death to the final scene in the book has also been shortened. While in the novel, it spans 4-5 years, in the film, it's less than 9 months. It's unlikely that such a short period could transform a 17-year-old boy into a leader of rebels.

The screenplay's shortcomings are fully compensated by the cinematography and artistic techniques. Each frame is a professional work of art. The wide shots of House Harkonnen's military might, the architecture of Arrakis, the eight-legged military vehicles, desert landscapes, and the Fremen riding on sandworms-all unfold on the screen accompanied by Hans Zimmer's hypnotic music.

Expressive techniques were also generously employed to enhance the visual context: Feyd-Rautha's battle with the captive warriors of House Atreides, the cannibals, the intimate scene in Lady De Vries' chamber, and more. It's precisely these non-verbal visual techniques that make viewers appreciate Villeneuve's films.""
The characters in Denis Villeneuve's film Dune have been meticulously crafted with attention to detail and aesthetics, even when it comes to the most unpleasant portrayals. Viewers don't need to search for hidden meanings behind the characters because the visual component makes them highly comprehensible.

Regarding the acting, we haven't seen anything fundamentally new compared to Dune 1. However, there are some notable aspects worth mentioning.

Director Villeneuve gave Paul Atreides less than 9 months for his transformation into Muad'Dib. Did Timoth√©e Chalamet manage this 'quantum leap'? In the final part of the film, Chalamet carries the emotional weight of almost all scenes, while other characters, including Jessica and Stilgar, take a backseat, serving as the backdrop for Muad'Dib. Whether the actor justified the director's trust is not a straightforward answer. Paul Atreides's internal ambivalence as a character is complex-on one hand, there's contradiction, vision, reflection, and doubt; on the other hand, there's determination, responsibility, and firmness. Perhaps due to the limited time, convincing execution of challenging scenes fell short. The director's mistake is that Muad'Dib may be the messiah, but not the executioner. Whether the actor had real chances for success with such a complex task remains an open question.

In Dune 1, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was the primary antagonist, but in Dune 2, we witness the rivalry between uncle and nephew, which turns into a true acting battle. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, although performing his role well, ultimately takes a backseat.""
Low-set eyes on a pale, cold face, and the black palate of a half-open mouth with plump, almost childlike lips magnetically draw attention. Austin Butler kept the focus of the audience on his character with a kind of cheeky ease while Timothee Chalamet went crazy with who he now has to show people: Paul Atreides, Muad'Dib, Usul, Kwisatz Haderach, Lisan al-Gaib. Butler doesn't have a lot of experience as a leading actor in box office films. The main role of Elvis Presley is rather an exception. However, Feyd-Rautha provides the best acting contribution in the second part of Dune. It's one of those cases where you want to witness character development, but the script doesn't afford that opportunity.

The film also sheds light on important contemporary themes through the events unfolding on Arrakis. It's not entirely clear whether Denis Villeneuve intended to draw parallels with the present day or if it's merely his interpretation of the original book's text.

Dune 2 vividly portrays the struggle against a cruel aggressor who plays the role of a colonizer and a sadistic killer. The 'good old simple solutions' involving artillery against the peaceful population of Siach Tabr to suppress resistance serve as a poignant example. The film also emphasizes the significance of possessing nuclear weapons, while climate change concerns take a backseat.

Among the Fremen, there's no unified survival strategy, and the choice between fighting and fleeing sparks heated debates. Resisting the aggressor could lead to a prolonged and bloody galactic war. Ownership of a valuable resource keeps the Fremen at the center of political battles.""
The fair-skinned aristocrat Paul Atreides attempts to find common ground with the Fremen. Despite his bold actions, he doesn't escape mockery from the native inhabitants of Arrakis. Paul becomes a messiah for the Fremen due to their fanatical belief in religious prophecies, but was it truly his desire, and are the Fremen ready to follow their Lisan al-Gaib beyond the boundaries of Arrakis?

The final scene of the power struggle in Dune 2 reveals that the Messiah on the throne transforms into a politician. Did his followers understand this? Perhaps the answers lie in the third installment of the saga.

In Denis Villeneuve's film, Princess Irulan possesses ambitions and motivations, unlike her portrayal in the original book. This adds intrigue to the anticipation of Dune 3. Additionally, viewers catch a glimpse of Paul's sister, Alia.

In Frank Herbert's novel, Chani is presented within the framework of a patriarchal world, but Villeneuve pushes her beyond those limits. Chani in the film is independent and self-assured, refusing to be 'first among equals.' The film's conclusion appears more vivid than in the book, thanks to sharp contradictions and conflicts among the characters, which piques interest for the future sequel.

Overall, Dune 2 has set the stage for an epic cinematic saga that science fiction enthusiasts have long awaited.",10.0,2,1,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.6833850741386414}",EMPTY
Dune: Part Two,"Dune, Good could have been Great","Good but definetly not ROTS and Dark knight level,
Too many details missing from the books, I realize this doesnt have to be completely faithful to the book but chani had a terrible character change here, so did stilgar. The movie does not seem faithful to the 500 page epic it was supposed to be, not enough shown about fremen culture, infact the fremen are dumbed down and made to look naive, the motives and the desires are not conveyed, the beautiful scene with jamis is missing and the topic of paul taking up a third wife was avoided. I dont mind these exact plot points missing but what they convey is missing too, The Fremen are supposed to be desert hardened super humans, they are selfless and dont just think about themselves, not just the tribe but future generations too, Paul's son is missign which was a vital part of his character it showed how far he had fallen and how his mentat brain things only rationally. The Harkonnens were terribly misrepresented too, Thufir Hawat is missing and the Dynamic with Feyd Rautha and the Baron is completely off things have not been explained very well.

Maybe if I had not read the books I could come here with an open mindset, probably is a great movie but it could be greater it just does not meet my expectations the way the first movie did, infact i'd say the first movie was far better, thought not 100% faithful either it conveyed what the first part of the book stands for perfectly.

Dune: Part Two,It surely isn't an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune,"Frank Herbert's (and to a lesser extent his son Brian Herbert) books are literary masterpieces. I have read all of them many times over the years and have never felt bored.

The Sci-Fi channel's adaptation of the books (made in the year 2000) is marvellous. It remains fairly true to the books and hence extremely watchable, repeatedly even. The successor series, Children of Dune, is not half-bad either. All with a star cast of not so well known actors, barring very few exceptions who are quite famous. And that series gets a rating of 6.9 while this trash movie gets 9, wow!

The first movie was quite good, the plot remained quite faithful to the books and overall, I looked forward to the second and maybe more instalments with some degree of anticipation.

But somewhere along the way, the decision to turn the multi-faceted epic to a space opera seems to have been made.

A few glaring divergences lead us to this travesty of a movie.

No mention of Dr. Liet Kynes in this movie, so some mystical mumbo-jumbo of greening.

No mention of Kanly, so the seriousness of the Paul-Feyd fight is dumbed down to a grudge match. Also, no Atreides gom Jabbar for the Baron Harkonnen.

The Bene Gesserit are reduced to one dimensional characters. Their only ""superpower"" is Voice. No mention of their ""weirding ways"". Their superior training leading to control over their body chemistry which is a critical component of the Water of Life transformation is glossed over to such an extent to be almost absent.

The whole Imperial setup is laughable. If the few images of Corrin are supposed to be representative, no wonder Shaddam is so pitiable a character. And let's not look at the caricatures that are the Sardaukar.

Lastly, what's with the exclusion of the Spacing Guild in this movie? After all, they were there in the first movie, albeit as minor characters. In the books, they were described as the third of a triad of political forces, the other two being the Emperor and the Great Houses. Without them, the climax sequence in this movie is greatly reduced. If you don't believe me, please take a look at the same scene in the Sci-Fi adaptation. Now that one is class all the way!

Overall, the only charitable conclusion I can make here is that this is a movie that borrows the title, the names of the characters and seemingly little else from the titular books. It definitely doesn't borrow the plot to any great degree, so this ends up being a boring pace opera.",1.0,144,242,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.5969698429107666}",EMPTY

Dune: Part Two,One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies,"Villeneuve returned to the world of Dune and created one of the darker blockbusters, a mixture of warring houses, psychedelic dreams, the feeling of fear hangs over us in the desert from fear itself, but not from the attack of a competing house, the danger is very existential, the protagonist is in a conflict against fate itself, when joined the Fremen pulls him in two directions, he eagerly rejects the Gesserit prophecy for a simple revenge, while in the meantime the factions of the Fremen fight for his place in their society, due to his willful ignorance he misses the truth that the prophecy and the Neff's mother can hardly be ignored. Timoth√©e Chalamet in such Paul's transition from a fighter to a leader, through a reluctant prophet to the final stage, he did a great job convincingly. A terrifying thing, where a hero becomes a victim of fate, and it is even more intriguing that he did it knowing the personal and political consequences from which there is no return, While on the other hand Rebecca Ferguson is in a creepy version, her stumbling through the film is quite spooky and she appropriated the role of Reverend Mother in full ecstasy and without thinking pushes her son towards his path. The lines between family and politics are increasingly blurred with her, and Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is the best new element of the film, the embodiment of pure inhumanity and madness, he and Paul have intertwined destinies that lead them to the final conflict, and the scene between him and Lea Seydoux is also simultaneous frightening and creepy. While Zendajaya has more minutes in this sequel and the chemistry with Paula is palpable, the cinematography by Greig Fraser shows the amazement of Arrakis and the true power of the desert and captures every element, there is also the unexplored south side, which weaves tragedy in the background, and the action scenes are also impressive from Harkonnen warriors who defy gravity or when the Fremen come out of the sand, and there is the first ride on the sandworm for the persecutor, which is a spectacle for the eyes and ears.

Dune: Part Two,I like it this movie,"I think this film is quite good. With David Lynch's Dune taking over 2 hours to cover the entire Dune book, causing huge pacing problems, and Jodorowsky's Dune was never made due to production issues that were planned to be 14 hours long. With the first two Dune adaptations (one not released) having length problems, one being long and the other being too short, Denis Villenueve's adaptation of Dune took a different approach by splitting the book in two. With the first release, the first part was phenomenal and a near perfect sci-fi epic with perfect pacing. Each individual plot event feels impactful and heavy. The minimal time constraints in part 1 make the film able to convey the story with depth, thus providing a very immersive and enjoyable experience. However, because Denis Villenueve decided to split the book into two when adapting it for the big screen, most of the story was left for just one film. Compression of all the events in the 2nd film results in a very fast paced film. Dune part 2 suffers greatly from this very fast pacing as every event that should be truly epic and meant to amaze you instead overwhelms you and thus makes the interesting events less epic. This film is absolutely fantastic. As anyone who has read this book knows, it is divided into 3 main parts. I believe it would be perfect if it was a Dune trilogy. Dune part 2 is sci-fi henna greatness, but I can't give it a 10/10 because of its very fast pacing. By combining all the incredible events into one film, many of the jaw-dropping moments from part 1 were lost for me. It's still amazing and if you ever see this film being re-released in theaters when Dune: Messiah comes out (or the miniseries max), I 100% recommend checking it out. If you like science fiction and just want to watch an entertaining film, I highly recommend Dune Part 2. I should also add to never watch this on the small screen.

Dune: Part Two,The best possible Dune adaptation,"Even though book purists may have issue with some changes and omissions, this is as close as we'll ever get to have a genuinely faithful adaptation of Herbert's classic.

The Director's vision of the Lisan Al Gaib's myth is probably the biggest difference between this film and the other two adaptations of the first novel. In this version we can clearly see the horrors to come, since no greater disgrace can befall a people than to be ruled by a hero.

I didn't watch Dune part 1 on the big screen, because I didn't expect much, but after watching it I realised I had messed up. Since I've completed the first part I've been waiting for this movie for one and half years, and it did not disappoint.

I had the pleasure to watch this on the big screen and boy let me tell it was an out of the world experience

Dune: Part Two,Too different from the book,"Dune Part 2 missed the mark for me. While it is visually appealing, it lacks the narrative depth and intrigue present in the novel. The book presents a complex web of plots and machinations interwoven into one story; the movie is more akin to other sci fi spectacles, and leans into an action movie vibe, which tonally doesn't work with the source material. It's like it's trying to be both things at the same time, and as a result accomplishes neither.

Many of the character arcs and storylines present in the novel are either heavily altered, or missing entirely. Naturally, a decent amount of this is to be expected whenever a narrative work is converted to film, but with Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2, the the changes are as numerous as they are baffling. Alia is never born in the film, and she doesn't kill the Baron. Paul does? (and the Emperor?) The introduction of Alia was perfect in book, and helps to revitalize the progression of events, keeping the story gripping and thought provoking. The movie on the other hand, spends an extortionate amount of time explaining the water of life, and exploring Jessica's new role as a Reverend Mother.

In summary, Dune Part 2 is a visually appealing, narratively lacking, cinematic experience, which is refreshing when contrasted with many other recent films. Those that are new to the dune universe will likely be somewhat entertained, whereas fans of the books will probably be frustrated at the various alterations and changes.",6.0,2,18,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'plot', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8874981999397278}",Negative
Dune: Part Two,Destruction and Chaos: The New Era,"Dune 2 is visually striking, and the music is a true work of art thanks to Hans Zimmer. I had never seen a film with such a perfect soundtrack, with well-marked sounds and moments of silence.

The story follows the trajectory of the first installment, with a balanced intensity in terms of action scenes, dialogues, and tense situations. This creates moments where you are completely attentive to the big screen, while others allow you to rest a bit.

The film progresses slowly, but the music immerses you and draws you in, depicting a world of destruction and chaos where characters fight for their causes. The main actor's evolution is enormous, and his performance is majestic. The dialogue scenes are well-planned, and the plot has an element of mystery with unresolved questions that make you eager to see the next installment.

The created world of Dune is vast and visually beautiful. The dynamics, gadgets, weapons, and sandworms bring everything to life.

Dune: Part Two,Amazing experience,"This will easily go down as one of the best sequels ever made.

Denis really nailed everything. The relationships, the politics, the action, and even the religious aspects. It's all top notch. I was pretty much in awe for 90 percent of this movie, especially the last half.

Paul's rise to power was so well done and acted to perfection by Chamlet. I got chills in so many scenes of him just speaking and monologuing. That was probably my favorite aspect of the movie...I absolutely loved how they handled his rise to power. It felt profound and really resonated with me.

Zimmer's score was great, the cinematography was perfect, and all other technical aspects are 10/10. You wouldn't expect anything less from a movie with Denis at the helm.

I will say this, though. This movie should've been 3+ hours. So many things happen so quickly, and I wish we got more time with each of the events in the film. It felt a bit rushed at times. The scenes are INCREDIBLE...I just wish some of them were longer. They could've easily made a 3-and-a-half-hour ultra-epic and that would probably make this one of my favorite movies of all time.

Dune: Part Two,Dune Part 2: A Visually Stunning Epic that Is Going to Stand the Test of Time,"""Dune Part 2"" stands as a testament to the heights cinematic art can reach when sound, acting, storytelling, and visuals converge in a harmonious spectacle. This sequel continues to unravel the intricate tapestry of Frank Herbert's universe, achieving a complexity in narrative that is both commendable and ambitious. The performances are, without a doubt, stellar. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their character, enriching the sprawling narrative that spans across desolate landscapes and fervent political intrigue.

The sound design and score are, once again, unparalleled. They not only enhance the visual experience but also immerse the audience into the vast, sandy expanses of Arrakis and beyond. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is a meticulously crafted piece of art, showcasing the alien beauty of Herbert's universe with an attention to detail that is rarely seen in cinema today.

Despite these remarkable achievements, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative, while complex and engaging, is encumbered by the sheer weight of its own mythology. At a runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film occasionally feels lengthy, and its pacing suffers as a result. The story's grand scale and numerous subplots, though richly woven, sometimes lead to a narrative density that can be overwhelming. This is most evident towards the film's climax, where the rapid succession of dramatic events and crucial plot points can feel somewhat jarring, as if emerging from the ether rather than the story's natural progression.

This pacing issue could have been mitigated with a more balanced approach, perhaps by trimming certain scenes or redistributing the narrative focus. This would allow for a more even tempo and give the audience time to digest the complex developments without detracting from the story's immersive quality.

In summary, ""Dune Part 2"" is a film that dazzles with its visual and auditory spectacle, carried by powerful performances and a deep, intricate storyline. It is a worthy continuation of the saga that will surely satisfy fans and newcomers alike, despite its pacing issues and the daunting complexity of its mythology. It stands as a reminder of the power of science fiction to challenge, captivate, and transport its audience to worlds beyond their wildest imagination.",8.0,2,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,0,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9030781388282776}",Positive

Dune: Part Two,Tense. Arid.,"I'm not sure wether this film was meant to be unsettling and make the viewer uncomfortable.

If that was the objective, it sure delivers.

And I guess one should be feeling perturbed, due to the subject on hand, and the desert environment the story is set in.

Denis Villeneuve has made a master stroke here by rendering the desert life on screen, without the need to see much blazing sun, sweat and pain on the faces of characters.

But I do have to say that there were some missed marks here: when I saw Christopher Walken as the Emperor, I prayed to whoever that he wouldn't talk much, and I mean not more than three consecutive words. We've know him as the twisted baddy, the street smart wise guy.

He has no business playing an emperor! He can't talk like an emperor. He can only talk like a wise guy and it shows! Not a good choice here.

Javier Bardem was good in the first movie, but his acting wasn't believable in this second one. We've known him as a leader, and all of a sudden he's turned into a bigot from the 'south'. Somehow something missing in the play.

Dune: Part Two,An epic sequal,"Right out of the gate I want to state that I haven't read the brick of a book this is based on. In this instance however I feel you still can enjoy this fully.

On the other hand I do have watched the original movie as well as the previous part, which I found visually appealing but in some regards almost a trailer to this second part. The original movie from 1984 is its own chapter, and quite frankly shouldn't be associated with these films. I won't dwell more into that one here other than state that it was a ghastly picture.

With Denis Villeneuve once again at the helm I expected nothing more than a visual bombardment, which you indeed received. There was more of everything in this one, the visuals were truly spectacular. The score with grandmaster Hans Zimmer complemented the cinematography masterfully.

The cast was mostly competent with Timothee Chalamet being the one improving most from the returning cast. Found him engaging showing more emotion and stepping up as a leader. The love interest with Zendaya also felt bearable to watch. Some questions arose about the cast though. The most obvious was the casting of Christopher Walken as the emperor. As I wrote I haven't read the book but I have a hard time contemplating that was they way a mighty character as him was portrayed. He felt weak in every sense. Dave Bautistas character was such a footnote in this they might as well have left him out. Haven't seen Austin Butler in much, he probably is a capable actor, but here and for me he wasn't intimidating in the least. Florence Pugh and Anya Taylor-Joy were criminally underused but I recon that will change in the final part if this trilogy.

The story itself took a step forward in this part, it felt more fleshed out. The problem with pacing was regretfully still somehow present, especially towards the end. You still got a feeling this was an episode rather than a movie standing on its own.

But, these drawbacks should be considered minor glitches in an otherwise brilliant production. In a time of so much mediocracy in movies this deserves praise for the level of execution.

Dune: Part Two,Avatar for Grown Ups ;),"Just finished watching 1 hour ago this powerful display of story, visuals, and sound wrapped together in a saga forever traveling. Things you ask for in this film arrive and curiosity for more follows closely. This is my first review of any film I've looked at and I am happy to make Dune: Part Two my statement piece. This movie is the silent killer because I believe there will be quite a few that sleep on this film looking for a different action-type of blockbuster but believe you me after I watched the first Dune, I was hooked for the sequel.

Something never quite lured me before in the past when I watched parts of Dune, but delivery of this revisited epic introduces perfect calms before the storm as well as the endurance of their experience. You feel as if placed under a dreamlike trance, and when necessary, brought into focus for intentional importance.

Dune: Part Two,DUNE: PART TWO - 12/10 - UNDENIABLY THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR,"My mind is reeling.

That was one of the best films I have ever seen.

Dune: Part Two is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. High in the ranks with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, it stands strong in the center of a story, where other second installments have failed. The film picks up right after the ending of Dune: Part One. It feels as though the last 2 years and 4 months (the 2021 October release of Dune: Part One) have only passed in the blink of an eye. Dune: Part Two is crafted with precisely the same skill, passion, and creativity that Denis Villanueve and his team brought to Dune: Part One. It is impossible to select a favorite as they are just what they are titled - two parts of the same story. Watch Part One before going to see Part Two, and you'll walk away thinking it was a single 6-hour film.

Seamless.

The first act of Dune: Part Two is noticeably slower-paced than the first movie, so at first it's concerning as a potential indicator for the rest of the film. This first hour-and-a-half is dedicated to the development of the characters and important plot points and is interesting enough to keep you engaged. This section of the storyline climaxes with Paul riding the sandworm. The scene is astounding, powerful, jaw-dropping... it is the high point of Paul's character development arc.

See my list on Letterboxd, Best Moments in Film, for more iconic and powerful scenes.

Just when you're wondering when something terrible will happen, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen steps onto the screen. The middle of the film is dominated by the gladiator arena scene, shot in infrared black and white. This brilliant cinematography choice amplifies the contrast of the pale Harkonnens against their black war paint. It's more than enough to set you on edge and show you that Feyd-Rautha is a formidable enemy.

Austin Butler portrays this character with such fierceness. His expressions strike fear into the mind. However, there were a few moments when the voice he created for Feyd-Rautha seems to falter or crack, sounding fake instead of ominous. It is unexpected, given Butler's stellar work on Elvis, but only a slight hiccup in the grand canvas of Dune. The Baron's nephew is chilling in every scene, a perfect role to rachet up the intensity of the Baron's villainy in Dune: Part One. Florence Pugh also joins the cast with an external view of the events unfolding on Arrakis. Her levelheaded portrayal of Princess Irulan, the emperor's daughter, is the ideal balance to the unhinged and ""psychotic"" Feyd-Rautha.

Rebecca Ferguson and Timothy Chalamet take their characters to new depths only hinted at in the first film. Ferguson transforms Lady Jessica's character from her life as an Atriedes, wife to Leto, into a Bene Gesserit Revered Mother for the Fremen, authoritative and all-knowing. Paul develops into manhood as he follows his road into the desert and away from his mother. His chemistry with Zendaya is tender as he struggles between the path of Fremen life and becoming their prophetic messiah. Chani's role is well-written to provide a contrast of softness to the harsh desert and chaos of the story. The cast as a whole is phenomenal. Hats off to them for bringing the story and world of Dune to life.

At a certain point in the story, there is a significant point of view shift. It's directed very seamlessly, but it's noticeable. Through Dune: Part One and most of Dune: Part Two, we are experiencing the story through Paul's eyes... and then, we are shut out. He knows everything now, so we can no longer see what he sees. This matches and emphasizes the shift in the storyline - just because Paul is becoming the messiah, doesn't mean it's a good thing. This was the whole point of Frank Herbert's books (so I've learned): the dangers of messianic prophecies.

There is something to be said of this; Herbert may not be far off. There are many messianic messages out there. Countless prophecies and promises of a person who would be a savior to the people of that culture, religion, tribe, nation... but none of those 'saviors' are actually able to save. There is one Savior, one Messiah. His name is Jesus. And there are countless prophecies about him (Old Testament of the Bible)... the difference, is that he can save - he DID save us. Those prophecies spoke of a man who would die for the sins of the world - for the sins of you and me - and that act would make us clean if we accept him as our Savior, our Messiah. Believe in those prophecies about Jesus, believe in Jesus the Messiah, and you will be saved.

There is a veiled tragedy, slowly unfolding in the characters and events of Dune. Underscoring this shift is Hans Zimmer's theme for Paul and Chani. Beautifully painful... tender and heartbreaking all at once. The very essence of bittersweetness. Once again, Zimmer's score is unmatched. I can barely believe my ears. Familiar themes heard in Dune: Part One have their moments, while we are also introduced to new themes, iconic to Dune: Part Two. If 'epic' was a sound, it would be this score.

I am so excited and feel so thankful to live in an era of film like this.

Dune: Part Two,Did the race for the 2025 Oscars start so soon?,"Do knowing the prophecies determine people's actions or are people's actions already destined to be? Perhaps that is the central idea of this film in which the prophecies (false or not) come true in favor of Paul-many-more-names, but partly directed by his mother.

The narrative picks up where Duna: Part One left off after Paul Atreides is rescued along with his mother, Jessica, by the Fremen. Guided by the visions he has had, he knows he must fight alongside them to defend their planet, while Jessica is convinced she can become leader of the Bene Gesserit to lead Paul to become THE leader by taking advantage of the religious beliefs of the people.

The second part of Dune has too much story in a script that couldn't take me by the hand through the film. I was lost in the passage of time. I was constantly thinking, how long has it been? Have they advanced days, weeks or months? Suddenly he is the leader, but he barely passed the first test. Have they already reached the south and left immediately? I think Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts created a not-so-clear script derived from an immense amount of story they wanted to portray.

The soundtrack by the great Hans Zimmer is a delight, mixing symphonic and electronic elements that are in keeping with the film's retrofuturistic touch. The sound editing of Richard King? Is a huge success, which complements very well with the music in the moments of battles and training (which are many). In these same scenes, the sound mix of Gareth John? Manages to immerse us in the setting of the scenes with the echoes of the rooms and the wind whipping the sand in the desert.

Another of the achievements of Dune: Part Two is the editing by Joe Walker that unites the images in a very successful way to immerse us in the altered perception of the visions, as well as the trepidation of the battles. Greig Fraser's photography in the visions is also beautiful, added to the very close-ups on the characters' faces in moments of tension that capture the looks and gestures that cannot go unnoticed, in addition to the play of colors that goes from black and white to earth tone saturation, depending on characters and locations on screen.

The visual effects are good, too, although here I feel like they stumble a bit with Patrice Vermette's production design, which feels very wooden on Zsuzsanna Sipos and Shane Vieau's sets. Yes, there are several moments when I didn't see the cities, I saw the models of the cities.

The costume design by multi-nominee Jacqueline West was also not as striking as it could have been. Retrofuturistic films always have that creative freedom for costumes with the possibility of imagining without limits.

The cast is good. All the performers committed to their roles and allow the film to engage through the characters. Rebecca Ferguson in a supporting role stands out and generates scenes even more attractive than those of Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya.

Dune: Part Two,An adaptation superior to those that preceded it,"Released three years later, Denis Villeneuve Dune: Part Two picks up where Dune left off, and although the two films were not actually made back-to-back, the join is almost seamless. Once again, the film - with a screenplay written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts - largely follows the plot of Frank Herbert's beloved novel, and despite a couple of significant changes, should delight fans of the source material.

As in the second half of the novel, much of the narrative focuses on Paul's Fremen training and gradual transformation into a legendary messiah, whilst showing the Harkonnens ruthlessly cementing their rule of Arrakis and Villeneuve exploring of much as Herbert's worldbuilding as the film format will sensibly allow. Thus on the one hand, we get sometimes gory details of the Fremen lifestyle are explored in detail, such as their recovery of water from corpses, and on the other the violent politics of both House Harkonnen and the larger Empire.

The same cast returns, with Timoth√©e Chalamet giving a believable performance as Paul Atreides completes his transformation from inexperienced young son of a noble house first to legendary messiah and - ultimately - to budding tyrant. Along the way, Paul falls in love with Chani, and chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya convinces as the romance between their characters develops.

The rest of the cast is equally impressive. Notably, Javier Bardem gives a slightly comic performance as Stilgar, which juxtaposes nicely with the seriousness of the other characters, whilst Christopher Walken is excellent as a scheming but aging, weak Emperor, gradually being overshadowed by the rising star that is his daughter, Florence Pugh's perceptive Princess Irulan. But the villains almost steal the show. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who already impressed in Dune, gets far more to do as Baron Harkonnen here, and he makes a great villain, as does Dave Bautista, returning as the brutal, snarling Rabban, and Austin Butler, who makes a convincingly psychotic Feyd-Rautha, with just a dash of nobility that is most obvious in his final line.

The action sequences are well choreographed, from the opening battle between Paul and Harkonnen troops, to the iconic fight between Paul and Feyd-Rautha, and there are some hugely impressive set pieces. The Fremen attack with the atomics and sandworms and subsequent battle is astonishing, and Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser provide unforgettable visuals, such as the gladiator sequence, which is filmed using black-and-white infrared cameras. They also make excellent use of the carefully chosen location footage, especially the Jordanian desert scenes, into which extensive special effects are seamlessly integrated. Once again, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack provides the finishing flourish.

In a notable change from the novel the timeline is compressed, so that Alia remains in utero and it is Paul who kills the Baron, which is arguably more dramatically satisfying, but will enrage purists.

Dune: Part Two,Unlike anything you've ever seen,"This is the best sci-fi film since the original Star Wars, perhaps even better. I cannot think of a single movie that has caused me to feel such a range of emotions. You will feel hyped, you will feel sad, you will laugh, you will feel religious fervour for a Messianic figure, then question yourself for feeling that way.

It's hard to say what others haven't already said about this blockbuster. I'll say that all good stories have a theme or message, and this story has multiple deep themes. The plot is a genius twist on the classic hero's arch. You will find yourself increasingly conflicted as the story progresses and this is reflected by the protagonists own struggle with his ""terrible destiny"".

This movie had me asking questions on the human condition, the nature of religions and the power of human consciousness. That's how well thought out the plot is. Credit of course goes to Frank Herbert, but Villeneuve did an incredible job at grasping the plot on a thematic level.

Chalamet gives a stunning performance. There are very few actors that can play a character that commands a room. It requires a real world gravitas. I'm delighted that my initial impression of Chalamet as a pretty boy actor was so wrong. This film solidifies him as a hall of fame performer.

I could go on for days about what I love about this movie. However, I'll say that the special effects, soundtrack are more than Oscar worthy. All of the supporting cast are phenomenal (Butler and Bardem especially).

I'll go on record and say this is the best movie in decades, and Villeneuve has edged out Tarantino as my favourite director.",10.0,2,6,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'soundtrack', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9650757312774658}",Positive

Dune: Part Two,Shoots big and mostly hits the mark,"POSITIVES:

1) The performances are almost all great. Timothee Chalamet really carries the film with the amount of screen time he has and I really thought he was sensational in portraying Paul's turn to the darkness, as were the vast majority of the supporting cast
2) The size and scale of this film are truly remarkable. You should see this film on the biggest screen you can with the best sound system you can. Denis deserves a lot of credit for holding the reins here and delivering a film that is not only grand in scale but also grand in terms of its themes and messages. Whether it's the huge epic battle sequences we see, or the intense hand to hand combat scenes with Feyd, the film was gripping in all its action scenes
3) Hans Zimmer truly brings his A game and the score for this film will be hard to beat when the Oscars come back around next year. He is an epic composer and this is a truly epic musical achievement
4) For a film only just under three hours long, I thought it flew over. I checked my watch once just in passing and couldn't believe that 2 hours had passed already, which is a great sign because usually I say that films should be shorter

NEGATIVES:

1) I mentioned that I thought the performances were ""almost all"" great. The one exception to that for me was Dave Bautista. I really like him as an actor and usually think he performs great, but here I just felt that the performance was very one dimensional. I'm pretty sure he yells every single line of dialogue he has and it just got irritating after a while
2) The first hour of the film was a bit of a slog for me, because it focuses almost exclusively on just meandering around with the Fremen. In fact, I found the Fremen sections of the film to be by far the weakest part. Whenever the Harkonnens or the Bene Gesserit were on screen I was loving it, but the scenes exploring Fremen culture and their religious beliefs were just a bit unnecessary for me because there are soooo many of them. Lady Jessica becomes Reverend Mother almost instantly and all the stuff about Stillgar being convinced Paul is their saviour even when he says he's not was almost comical at times and has already been made the focus of several memes online.",8.0,1,3,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8645132184028625}",Positive
Dune: Part Two,If You Thought the First Part Was Boring...,"As a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, I generally look forward to seeing new releases in this genre. However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can't begin to compare to my reaction to ""Part Two"" - an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I'm mystified that I haven't yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed - a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as ""Arrival"" (2016) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017) - but ""Part Two,"" like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I'm truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn't captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you're like me and found the first part boring, you'll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I'm certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn't waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, ""Dune: Messiah,"" is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the ""Dune"" films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Dark Knight"" series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, ""Dune"" and ""Dune: Part Two"" are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as ""Heaven's Gate"" (1980), ""Ishtar"" (1987) and ""Tenet"" (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature.

While the first one had good character relationships and sensible casting, and it made sense for the plot, even if it just felt like infodumping-this had none of that. Characters just popped up randomly and without explanation. Scenes started and then never ended. There seemed to be heaps of time skips with no explanation. One minute he was told to spend a night in the desert, next minute he's running with the other Fremen to take down a giant tank? Huh?

And the characters?! At least with the first one the multitude of famous actors played roles that made sense and were explained, but in this one they just popped up randomly and we were expected to understand who they were.

Dune: Part Two,One of the greatest films of all time. The most immersive cinematic experience since Lord of the Rings,"I love all six original books. I've now seen this three times so far in Imax. This film is perfect in every way. Passionately realized from start to finish. The performances, the music, the visuals, the sound design, the worldbuilding, the props, the story. Everyone who says it's narratively hollow has likely not read the books. Anyone with a real understanding of the Dune universe will appreciate how honestly and bravely it approaches its subject matter, how it nails every idea and theme that Frank Herbert crafted, and the importance of where it goes from here.

I love everything. Not a scene, word or frame feels out of place. Every speck of sand feels immaculately placed. Cons? Maybe Florence Pugh's delivery is at times stilted. . Information is repeated at a few points... But I would change virtually nothing. Denis Villeneuve has achieved his dream and the dream of many other filmmakers before him. The visuals are unforgettable but the film is also filled with substance, emotion, gravitas, romance and even humor. Javier Bardem in particular is so wonderful to watch on screen that I would consider him for a best supporting actor award. The whole rest of the cast also delivers near career best performances. Austin Butler is a revelation as the sadistic but complex Feyd Rautha. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista are everything you want them to be and more. Souheila Yacoub lit up the screen. Rebecca Ferguson is equal parts terrifying and enchanting. Charlotte Rampling and Lea Seydoux - stellar. Zendaya has never been better. Timothee Chalamet cements his place as one of the best actors of his generation, playing one of the most complex characters in all of science fiction and nailing every nuance. He absolutely commands the screen.

This film is like a moving painting, utterly gorgeous. Completely spellbinding. I didn't want to leave Arrakis at the end. It feels like the kind of film I've waited all of my life to see. I feel very happy to be alive in this time and place to witness it and I thank every single person who worked on this film, every person who dreamed and willed it to be, Frank Herbert and David Lynch, and humanity as a whole for accepting this universe into their hearts and making it a success. Dune Part 2 is titanic, psychedelic, dark, intelligent, complex, sumptuous, and spectacular. Made with absolute care, respect and love in every regard.

Dune: Part Two,Mesmerising,"This movie is 3 hours long but the time just flies by as you're transported into the world of Dune. The acting is brilliant and the design of the Bene Gesserit outfits is really cool, you just delight in seeing them appear on screen.

A must watch movie of 2024, it will definitely be one of the top 10 movies of this year. I don't rewatch a lot of movies, but I know I will rewatch this one. It's even better than Part One.

The one thing to nitpick is Chani's aversion to Paul's growing power (before his marriage proposal to Irulan, I mean that's just cheating on her). The tone of the Dune universe isn't hopeful and glossy like Star Trek, it leans more towards dark and ambiguous. I feel it would fit better if Chani had been depicted as conflicted (perhaps along with many of the fighters), because yes Paul is clearly manipulating the Fremen using their belief system but on the other hand we're never shown anyone else who may be able to lead the Fremen to victory. Pragmatic support in lieu of viable alternatives. Chani's moral objections seem taken from a college campus but her character has experienced too much hardship and has too much life experience to act in such a naive way. Whereas it's convenient (and comforting?) to operate on a binary moral spectrum, I just don't see that fitting into the character of Chani, maybe if she was sheltered and at least upper middle class or something, but she's just not.",8.0,1,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7755458354949951}",EMPTY
Dune: Part Two,Denis shows the way,"Both part one and two incorporates storytelling by showing. He tease by leaving things out, to ponder until next title maybe or left with purpose of individual interpretation. Like a good book, it's your own imagination running the show where things are a bit unclear. For example, how do you get off the worms or get a bigger group to piggyback. What do the Fremen eat? Spared us some less stomach friendly scenes I reckon. (Why does the moon have a moon, what faction maintain it and what does it power... No don't elaborate on that, just crazy me being me.) Also how bonkers do sandworms go with the shields in worm territory. Chanis friend Shishakli stays instead of Paul whom at first insist that everyone but he should go south, when attacked. Why she would do this is also up for individual interpretation.

The time of the movie is distributed so that it goes slow when Pauls mind is a cluster, feelings and visions. After the water of life the pace itself shows that Paul have a very clear view of the future. Even the fight with Austin Butler, We've been showcased that they both can fight but my interpretation is that Feyd is far superior. The ""he's bluffing"" I take as foreshadowing into the wounded lung noises Paul makes while stabbed... Having Feyd lower his guard. And that taking the hit was part of the path.

Part one is the buildup and part two is the payoff. All supporting roles impressed me, they are the breathing foundation, especially for a cheddar-epics like this.

Dune: Part Two,"""May thy knife chip and shatter.""","The word epic when describing certain big-budget movies is often overdone and rarely rings true to the quality of the film. Besides going towards the actors' egos, you never feel the epic scale or where the trillion of money went. Nowadays, big-budget movies look phony and rushed. There is no sense of passion or soul. It must also include cinematic richness in the filmmaking, pacing, and intelligent scene choices. For a while, since cinemas re-open after COVID, I thought that we would never get that anymore. This new age of factory-made products that you blankly stare at for hours and then quickly forget about when the credits roll. I am feeling less excited about new releases.

But after watching Dune: Part Two, everything that I thought was missing in big-budget movies is found here. This movie gave that to me.

Dune: Part Two blew me away! It was one of the best IMAX experiences I have ever had. I have seen it twice already, and it is the type of movie that should stay in cinemas, especially in IMAX. It's been a while since I was in awe watching something so massive, ambitious, and executed wonderfully. I liked the first Dune, but this is MILES BETTER. This is more like it! The scope and scale were monumental! What I loved the most was the movie has this sense of spirituality and sacredness felt through the score, cinematography, costumes, and production design.

This is already one of the best movies of 2024 so far. Whether or not that title gets topped, for now, it's my favourite of 2024.

The opening scene is one of the strongest of the year/of all time, as it perfectly welcomes you back into the world and sets you up for the visual journey ahead. The uses of colour this time around, with the use of striking dune orange, harsh colours, and how the colour palette represents different locations and characters.

Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the best filmmakers of our time. This guy keeps winning and will follow a similar path to another director, Christopher Nolan. He's a director who makes bold and clever choices.

I was more invested in this world than I had before. There's a fancy and sci-fi name to it, but I call it space religion. This movie leans more into the weird and creepy world of Dune. It's interesting to see how water and any other fluid are sacred and should not be put to waste. So, no crying and no throwing up. Even after someone dies or is about to die, all the water inside of us gets sucked out with a device to avoid it going to waste.

I find Timothee Chalamet overrated in certain movies. If you have seen my Wonka review, you have seen one out of many examples of me not connecting with his performances. The others are Hot Summer Nights, Beautiful Boy, and The French Dispatch. However, in Dune: Part Two, I thought he was incredible. It is his best performance since Call Me by Your Name. I loved his character arc here. From where he starts to where he ends up is tragic. It is a classic tragedy of a beautiful angel stripped away of his wings, falling into the depths of hell, and becoming the devil in the eyes of non-believers. He commands the screen, holds your attention, and has a sweet fury of revenge in his system. It was magnetic to watch.

Zendya has more screen time and plays a crucial role in the story, where her character is the only sane and reasonable person. But her scenes with Chalamet and their eventual romance, which could have easily come across as cheesy or forced, were instead sweet, pure, and believable.

But Austin Butler blew me away here. The first time he opened his mouth and said his first line, my jaw was on the floor because I could not believe that voice was coming out of him. Butler sounded just like Stellan Skarsgard. It was unbelievable. He plays the role of Feyd-Rautha, an absolute psychopath who thrives on pain, both inflicting on others and himself. In a scene where he sees if the knives presented to him are sharp enough, he stabs and slashes those around him to test their quality. After killing them, ""It's not sharp enough"". But he is not without showing respect if you earned it. From Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Elvis, The Bikeriders, and this movie, Butler continues to excel in every role.

The supporting cast: Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Lea Seydoux, Florence Pugh, Stellan Skarsgard, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, and Christopher Walken were all terrific in their roles, and there is so much depth to the characters, both in the writing and acting, that with each repeat viewing brings new details.

Also, not forgetting Dave Bautista, who is more than just muscle but a complex character who is vulnerable, scared, rageful, and wounded, and Bautista played it brilliantly. He is the best wrestler turned actor in the business.

The score from Hans Zimmer is nothing short of extraordinary. It is grand and hits the perfect notes. There were points where it reminded me of Greek composer Vangelis, especially his work on Blade Runner. I have listened to the Quiet Between the Storms score countless times and countless more. For me, the score triggers a feeling of joy, pain, and unknown euphoria.

The sound work deserves mention, as it was detailed and added to the overall experience of this other world.

The visual effects, production, and costume designs were all superb.

There were points where it felt like a horror movie. It gave me an uncomfortable chill down my spine, which I did not expect going in. The hero character type gets flipped on its head. The horror behind using religion to achieve power and control will not be terrifying.

I have been debating ever since I first saw this - should I give this the perfect five-star rating? I don't usually give these out like candy.

Dune: Part Two,Almost six hours and sand and still amazing,"The expectations where so high, they've scraped the sealing from the floor. No matter how much time it has grown, as for the first movie runtime, I was sure it will hold well. Denis Villeneuve's work is always amazing and there was no reason for this time to be less spectacular from all his latest jobs.

I went to the cinema and paid money after over a decade of getting free tickets to all the premiers, so it was an internal sign for me, and for others, regarding how I felt about the movie, before watching it, how anticipated it was and how much this movie was important to me.

Lately I completed the first movie, at a second viewing, in order to remember it and be prepared. I've also started to read the book and with the distance memory of Lynch's first movie (which I watched twice and didn't like them) I was equipped properly to see the biggest event in cinemas for this calendric year.

It sends out for numerous reasons - it is a movie that you must watch at the big screen. It is a cinematic event and one of few that gets the audience really exited and it live through the expectations.

But...and its a big but... its doesn't live up to every expectation and it is not perfect and not deserving the mega hype it got. Not a 9, but a solid 7.5 - 8. Its perfect with all regarding the directing and cinematography. Special effects are of the chart, and you cannot expect to get what you get; vocally, if you will wait to see it indoor.

Go see it on the biggest screen you can. And them the ""But"" is snicking. Because after cleaning all the background noise and how it affects the viewers, after filtering the visual impact on the viewers and after understanding the significant of this movie to the cinema as a savior and a sample of spice out of all the generic sand we get in movies lately, after all of those, we still got several important issues and problems.

The characters...there are a lot of them. Not all of the characters get the appropriate treatment and though it is a very (Very!) long movie, it seems that some of them are kept as a decoration and maybe as a preparation for next chapter. Paul, Chani, Jessica and even stilgar get their fair share, but others don't evolve as much as expected.

This fact effects the attachment of the viewer to the characters and to the movie as a whole. We get thrown from one character to another, without building care or affection and it is hard to develop any concern to most of the characters that get one or two sentences per half an hour.

The general atmosphere of the movie is very heavy and seems as if we are not allowed to get attached to most living creatures, but need to get attached to the intoxicating elements that divides this movie from others. It causes some detachment and makes a will to appreciate the movie from a far and not get to attached to it, emotionally.

And finally - the length.... almost three hours that seem to be just too much. I leave the concept of the movie as a religious conversation and other subtext and deep topics to the book to deal with. All of those are not an ideas by Villeneuve but are Frank Herbert's.

I thought about the matrix so much, and how this movie is reminding the matrix, but remember that Herbert was here first and probably invented all of the rough lines for every matrix original thought. It was a lot to digest and probably will wait a little bit to see is as a mini-series, at home.

Dune: Part Two,"Not a bad film, but...","It's extremely overrated and this rating should definitely come down a bit. It's about an 7.5/10, ignoring the story of the book which was well and truly massacred in this soulless Hollywood adaptation.

Let's talk about the positive things first: The parts of the music in the first half that sounded like an exact copy of Vangelis (what a legend!) and thus were beautiful. I'm not a Zimmer fan. Austin Butler did a phenomenal job for what he was given. I can't fault Chalamet either. I was impressed by Javier Bardem, who became his role. Stilgar was the heart of the story. Ferguson also was very good, but she was the standout of the first part too. The visuals were indeed very impressive. This was a visual masterpiece, I have to say. Absolutely loved the Harkonnen aesthetic in clothes, though maybe not the cartoonish villains they were portrayed as.

Now, for the bad parts: If I could remove one thing from this film, it would be zendaya. Her ugly mug brought down the whole entire film, not just the character (which was butchered in this version) but her appearance too. Constantly argumentative and negative, she never believed the prophecy for a minute, even though every step was confirmed in front of her eyes. We did NOT need so many close ups, for Mahdi's sake! In essence, she was not believable as a love interest, but also her acting was literally one note, constantly the same expression of being severely constipated and disgusted. She was essentially a bigger villain than the Harkonnens. Even though Paul explained exactly what was going to happen according to his plan a minute earlier, she stormed off when he did what he explained he would do and after he had told her he would love her forever.

My biggest complaint is that tribes cannot be multiracial because they're genetically related. An Atreides cannot be both an Asian and a black guy. The vast difference between the accents literally took me out of the movie, but especially zendaya's speech pattern, which at times came straight out of the Bronx, it was very jarring. The scene with Paul taking the water of life was kind of hilarious the way it was portrayed, I especially chuckled with the look Jessica gave Chani. I got scared a little bit with that very short woman who extracted the water of life from the worm, I was afraid she was about to twerk.

So, in short, visually very impressive, but ultimately hollow. The actual story is much deeper and way more complicated and nuanced. The casting of Chani is the single greatest mistake here, because she plays a key role and needs to be believable.",5.0,9,12,anger,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.4926164448261261}",EMPTY

The scale of the entire production is of epic proportions...but the movie is insanely boring. We once again follow characters moving through the desert - and honestly, the film is about as interesting as...well, watching the desert! The pacing is incredibly slow, and on top of this there are way too many characters and back stories with too little exciting happening. I thought the first film was slow, but this one is moving along at HALF the pace!!

And speaking of characters; none of the characters were truly standout characters - no, not even Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet). I must say, for a protagonist he isn't a likeable character, and no, I don't think I really rooted for him. On the contrary, he annoyed me more often than not. In fact, MOST of the characters annoyed me. Take the visuals away, and what do you have? Still a compelling film? No.

'Dune: Part Two' can be seen as a religious film, and in case you're wondering it is not religious as in Christianity. This is about religion - 8,000 years from now. There has always been religions. They come and go and new religions are invented - just as Christianity was just over 2,000 years ago. The film sees the rise of another (religious) leader 8,000 years from now. This is Paul Atreides, or Usul as he is named. Some say he is a Messiah; some say he is a false prophet. They say nothing can be achieved without faith, and that they will make the non-believers believe. Any of this sound familiar?

Apart from the visuals, this ""epic masterpiece"" failed to impress me. It is a long and slow film, and no, I did not understand everything that was going on. Every scene dragged - or at least, it felt that way. An hour into the movie, it still felt like an introduction to a movie and I still had very little idea what it was actually all about. They kept talking about spice, but to me it was more about the rise of a (new) religious leader.

It also felt like the film incorporated ideas from about a dozen movies or so. And despite set more than 8,000 years into the future, the film still had medieval elements. I mean, these people have spacecraft and powerful weapons, but they fight with swords!!! Seriously!!?? Why are there hardly any gunfire during battle scenes? This is the future, right? Right? Oh, and that cliched hand to hand combat scene climax...yawn already, Hollywood!! And is that love story supposed to be a love story???

'Dune: Part Two' leaves the door wide open for Part Three - which I will NOT be watching...Ugh, I'm just not a fan!",5.0,6,10,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.7500953674316406}",EMPTY
City Hunter,Rather enjoyable...,"Granted, I've never watched the animated series upon which this 2024 movie is based, so I have no idea how true the movie is to the source material. Nor do I know whether or not you need to have watched the series in order to fully appreciate this 2024 movie from director Y√ªichi Sat√¥.

Regardless, when I happened to stumble upon ""Shiti Hanta"" (aka ""City Hunter"") by random chance here in 2024, of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch it. I mean, given my love of the Asian cinema and this being a Japanese action comedy, of course I was interested in watching it.

Writers Tsukasa H√¥j√¥ and Tatsuro Mishima managed to put together an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline. And I was definitely adequately entertained throughout the course of the 102 minutes that the movie ran for. And director Y√ªichi Sat√¥ managed to present a movie that definitely felt like it was spawned of Anime, given the characters, mannerisms, dialogues, etc. So if you enjoy Anime and live-action renderings of Anime movies and series, then you're in for a treat here.

The character gallery in ""Shiti Hanta"" was good, and there were some very interesting characters. And I have to say that the writers did good jobs on fleshing out the characters and making them distinguishable and memorable on the screen. The character gallery in the movie really added a lot of flavor to the movie.

I have seen actor Ryohei Suzuki and actress Misato Morita somewhere before, I just can't put my finger on where. I have to say that the acting performances in the movie were good, and they definitely had a talented ensemble of actors and actresses.

""Shiti Hanta"" looked great, and there is a lot of visual treats to take in throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up to the cinematography and the wardrobe department that worked on the movie; they really did phenomenal jobs.

There is also a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, and it was filmed in a very energetic and dynamic way, making it feel like the audience is right there along the actors and actresses on the screen. The acting sequences looked great and added a lot to the overall impression of the movie.

I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of this movie, and it is definitely a movie that is well-worth sitting down and checking out if you enjoy Japanese cinema and Anime.

My rating of ""Shiti Hanta"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,3,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'actor', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.976934015750885}",Positive
Spaceman,"With, or without the space, it's the same old story.","I've seen this movie before; it's called Ad Astra. Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.

While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused clich√©.

Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really.

Spaceman,Thought-Provoking with Something Missing,"When Adam Sandler changes gears to work on a dramatic film, I'm always intrigued and willing to give it a chance. I'm not sure if he will ever top performances like he gave in Reign Over Me or Punch Drunk Love, but these days, I feel that his comedy has slipped away from him (in terms of feature films). Well, I stand by that last statement because Netflix has just released his latest dramatic effort in the film, Spaceman, and while I have my complaints, this is a good film with a solid performance at the forefront. It's been a while since I've liked Sandler this much to be honest. If you're into sci-fi, I recommend this one and here's why.

The majority of the film takes place on a spaceship near the planet Jupiter. This backdrop ended up being slightly disappointing though because the film is really about the reflection of a love story between Jakub (Adam Sandler) and Lenka (Carey Mulligan). Being alone in space has him grieving the ending of their relationship in his way, but things switch gears when he is visited by a giant spider, voiced by Paul Dano. This aspect may seem bizarre and at first, I even thought it didn't fit with the rest of the film, but it grew on me. The meaning of the spider is what made the movie what it is ultimately, so I liked it. My biggest complaint with this film in general though is the fact that the sci-fi elements are quite cerebral and engaging, so why didn't they choose to explore that a little more? Those were easily my favourite moments of the film.

Sandler gives a surprisingly restrained performance here, never going over the top or trying too hard and never getting too sentimental either. I'm surprised they gave his character barely a line of humour and his few brief scenes with Milligan felt authentic. Director Johan Renck helms his very first feature film after working as a director for many years on television and music videos. He cut his teeth on shows like Breaking Bad and Chernobyl, so it's no surprise that this was also well-directed. Some viewers may find his choice of pacing a tad slow, but I was sucked in by it. I truly feel that the lack of exploration outside of the romance story did hurt my experience though.

Spaceman is a film that satisfied me in terms of the story it was choosing to tell, but I felt like so much more could've been explored, which I admit is a personal nitpick, but it stuck with me. There are a few metaphors I enjoyed as well and it's all around a solid, solid movie, right down to the great score and pretty decent CGI. Scoring this one is odd for me, so due to my complaints, I'll knock it down a few notches, but I still recommend it and think it's really good for what it is. Now streaming on Netflix, there are far worse films out there than Spaceman. So again, I recommend this one.",7.0,21,34,surprise,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7599139213562012}",EMPTY
Spaceman,The (Emotional) journey of a Spaceman,"I've known nothing about this movie before seeing it. I'm not a cinephile so this definitely subverted my expectations.

This is a case of substance over style. It's funny, it's emotional and incredibly original. I appreciate original ideas and execution. Despite the space setting of this movie, it's certainly not centered around it. It's more of a self-discovery of Jakob. Speaking of Sandler, this is probably the most dramatic he's been. Hanus, his arachnid companion, despite appearing early on as somewhat of an entity of Jakob decaying mental health turns out be an extraterrestrial creature who provides solace for Jakob and allows him to reflect upon himself.

A few nitpicks here however, anyone in the cast besides Jakob are underdeveloped and solely exist when the plot needs them to. The Czech Republic setting is not given much definition and relocating it to other nation wouldn't make much of a difference. Despite it's originality, the film isn't prone to veering into clich√©s once every while. The score, despite sounding unique most of the time, descends into sentimentality later on, and the over-explanatory script irritated me.

Overall, as much as I praise this film for its visual style, heavy-handed themes and soulful performances, it does lack in some significant aspects that weigh down the overall weight of the central story.

Spaceman,Diet Tarkovsky,"If you dig things like Solaris (either version), you're gonna love this one, except it might be a little shallow and entertaining for you. If there are 2 things I don't like, spiders and Sandler, in this film (make that three, any resemblance to Tarkovsky), I somehow braved watching it. If you are horrified by spiders, fear not, this one is fairly cuddly and never shown for more than a split second in full body form.

Sandler does a wonderful job in a dramatic role here. He's left his wife to go gallavanting off into the stars, leaving his pregnant wife alone back in Czechoslovakia, and she's up to there with his lack of empathy for her. The wise alien spider psychoanalyzes him en route to some space anomaly (no, not the planet Solaris, but close), and one thing and another (spoiler alert!), love is regained.

Rather tender ending. I'm pleased to say this film is not another hairball coughed out by Netflix. It was plenty entertaining to watch and had you never heard of Tarkovsky, you'd say it was brilliantly original. Be warned, it does lack the usual space opera action like meteor storms, EVA's gone bad, astronauts with wrist mounted LED flashlights peering into smoky caverns, that sort of thing.

Spaceman,"""Skinny human.""","I apologize Mr. Sandler I was not familiar with your game. I haven't seen any films starring/featuring Adam Sandler other than his comedy movies which are all very entertaining for the most part (Pixels is peak, but I have yet to see a serious or non-comedic side of him yet as I haven't watched Uncut Gems even though it's been on my watchlist for years. So I am very impressed with just how good he was in this movie, I did not expect it out of him but I was pleasantly surprised and after this I cannot wait to watch Uncut Gems because I hear that's the best performance he's ever had. Although Adam Sandler is really the main character and probably my favorite of the cast, that isn't to say the rest of the cast aren't phenomenal as well, because they really all brought their a-game to this project and I was eating up every second of it. Adam Sandler's character Jakub's wife Lenka, played by Carey Mulligan, is also a very interesting and well written character that I felt myself in their conflict and wanting a resolution to it all. As she is nearing the birth of their baby throughout the film and is upset at him for leaving her and not opening up to her during their relationship, while he is plagued by guilt that is the root of his unwillingness to open up and his desire to go on this space mission even if he doesn't truly want to do it. It's really well written conflict that gets drip fed throughout the duration of the film and is one half of what makes it such an easy and entertaining movie to get through. The other half of the intrigue and pull for this movie is the weird spider alien thing that appears out of nowhere on Jakub's ship, which is played by Paul Dano who is just such a good actor and his work in this film was genuinely perfection. The sheer volume of talent on display from his voice acting work here was amazing. He really made me feel bad for and life a giant talking alien spider, and I didn't even know that was possible before I watched this film. Paul Dano is one of my favorite actors as of late, mainly due to his outstanding work as The Riddler in 2022's The Batman, and I also loved him in Prisoners (2013). Although, I don't even think the acting or writing was the best part about this film, don't get me wrong it was really good and I loved practically every second of it. Yet I think the thing that this movie did the best was it's visuals, this is one of the most visually stunning films I've watched in a while and the outer space stuff reminded me a lot of the first time I ever watched Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014). It was all just so vibrant, beautiful, and honestly trippy as hell. The big mysterious purple rift in the sky that both Jakub and Hanus (Paul Dano spider) are drifting towards during the majority of the film, is one of the most gorgeous yet terrifying images I've ever laid eyes upon; and I really really liked that. I don't think this is a film for everyone, as I can see a lot of people going into this with wildly different and varied expectations. One could go in expecting something more comedy driven given the fact that's what Sandler is most known for, and they could've seen the trailers and expected a horror movie based on the gigantic talking spider (even though it's Paul Dano so there's never a world in where he's all that frightening). But in all honesty this movie has elements of both of those, but is a very different feeling film than you'd expect. It deals with a lot of very heavy topics such as grief, guilt, depression, anxiety, and a whole lot of loneliness. But at the same time it's a very uplifting time, about working through traumas and coming to terms with your past and trying to fix things as you move forward; using the rest of your life to make the right decisions. And for that I really liked it, it somewhat drags since it does basically all take place on one space ship for two hours and almost entirely consists of just dialogue. Although I wouldn't let that deter you from checking it out, it's a really good time that made me tear up and almost cry so that always get a movie recommendation out of me. It's well acted, well written, well directed, well shot, has some fantastic music/sound, and also has some really impressive digital effects with the way it presents itself; from the spider, to the cosmic rift in the sky, to the visions Adam Sandler's character gets. It's all really cool and I liked it a whole lot. It just came out on Netflix a few days ago and I definitely think it's worth the time, but I can totally see why this wouldn't be everyone's thing. Although for me, one of the best films of the year (from those that I've seen).

I'm not sure why the alien looks so much like a spider. Did this mean something to Jakob? Did his subconscious manifest the spider and if so, why that form? Or was it really an alien who infiltrated the ship, and took this form for some reason? Wouldn't a form more acceptable to humans be better, after studying them for so long, learning the English language, etc? Maybe a dog, perhaps?

Some comic relief with the spider loving Nutella (tastes like home) and Jakob finally embracing the spider, didn't make up for the slow pacing and zero compassion for the main character.

The Wild Robot,Chris Sanders strucks gold once again with an instant classic from a literary phenomenon that is Ruby Gillman & Cast Away meets Avatar & Iron Giant. A triumphant Masterpiece,"Legendary Oscar nominated filmmaker Chris Sanders had triumphant in creating an instant classic in feature animation once again. After directing an adaptation of Jack London's classic The Call of the Wild, Sanders adapted an number 1 bestselling novel by Peter Brown called The Wild Robot, it's a heartwarming emotional tearjerking science fiction drama about a robot named Roz, who is stranded in a uninhabited island, and must learn to adapt the surroundings and have responsibility of adopting a young orphaned gosling named Brightbill.

Sanders, who wrote and directed the film made the film a masterpiece, with his longtime collaborating partner and executive producer Dean DeBois, and producer Jeff Hermann, Sanders had joined forces with Dreamworks Animation, the studio that made Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken, to create this groundbreaking animated masterpiece.

With Oscar Winner Lupita Nyongo in the lead as Roz, along with an all star voice cast, groundbreaking animation, and a heartwarming story that brings the literary phenomenon to life.

The visual storytelling were influenced by films like James Cameron's Avatar films, Brad Bird's Iron Giant, Zemiecks's Cast Away and Kirk DeMicco & Faryn Pearl's Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken while the emotionally character driven acting were also influenced by films like Nick Cassavetes's My Sister's Keeper, Tony Goldwyn's The Last Kiss, Nigel Cole's A Lot Like Love, and R. J. Cutler's If I Stay. Sanders, and the film's Head of Story Heidi Jo Gilbert had crafted a beautiful and heartwarming script and story that developed the emotional relationship between Roz & Brightbill, and setting a even more serious tone that no animated movie had ever gone before.

The voice cast were amazingly well picked, with Lupita as Roz, along with newcomer and British sensation Kit Connor as Brightbill, Pedro Pascal as Flick, voice-acting legend Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, Catherine O'Hara as Pinktail, UK sensation Matt Berry as Paddler, Bill Nighy as Longneck, Stephanie Hsu as Vontra, and Ving Rhames as Thunderbird The Falcon (a brand new character created for the film), they give their best performance that could give this film an potential Oscar frontrunner for best animated feature.

Sanders had assembled a team of animators, artists, and VFX designers to create a revolutionary and groundbreaking style that was influenced by some of the recent innovations in feature animation with stylized 2d/3d hybrid looks to bring Roz and the world of The Wild Robot to life.

The music and songs were beautiful written and performed, with Academy Award winner Kris Bowers chosen to write the score and songs alongside pop star and singer-songwriter Maren Morris performing 2 original songs written for the film, which includes the indie-folk ballad Kiss The Sky, which is very important to the film.

The film's core message of tech, climate, survival and tearjerking emotional drama made this film a true winner out of all of the other animated films released this year.

It's one of the best animated films of the year, an unforgettable landmark in feature animation since last year's Ruby Gillman.

It's a winner.",10.0,152,60,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'act', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9726563096046448}",Positive
The Wild Robot,"Very good, felt too rushed.","In all aspects, the movie was nearly perfect, from the stunning visuals to the heartwarming storyline. However, I felt that it was a bit too rushed. The pacing didn't allow enough time to fully develop the relationships between the characters, and I found myself wishing for more moments to connect with them on a deeper level. If the movie had been at least 30 minutes longer, I think it would have allowed for more character development and emotional build-up, making those key moments hit even harder.

Despite this, the movie was still very enjoyable. One of the aspects I truly appreciated was the humor. It was light, well-placed, and added a nice balance to the overall tone. Importantly, it didn't overshadow the emotional moments or take away from the heart of the story, which was all about relationships and growth.

The Wild Robot,Unbelievably emotional and moving,"POSITIVES:

1) The voice performances are really great, especially the central three of Lupita Nyong'o, Pedro Pascal and Kit Connor. They portray so much personality and emotion through their voices
2) The film has multiple really powerful messages that have made me feel a determination to become a better person as a result, as will hopefully also be the case for the target audience of young children. The themes around family, love and wildlife preservation, to name but a few, are done in such an engaging way
3) The film is insanely emotional and powerful. I'm a grown man and I have to confess to completely weeping at several points throughout this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was literally sobbing at several points throughout the last hour or so of the film. It is just so so emotional and moving and tugs at the heartstrings in the best possible way
4) I genuinely think the relationships and dynamics between the central three characters in this film are some of the best I've seen on film, certainly my favourite of this year so far

NEGATIVES:

1) A very slight and picky criticism, but as the film is obviously meant for kids it meant that certain moments of intended humour were just a bit eye rolling for me
2) Another very slight and picky criticism, but the idea at the end of the film that Roz turns herself back on despite being switched off when Brightbill snuggles into her on the ship, and still recognises Brightbill at the end despite having her system reset, and that the reason for this is because despite being a robot she has deep thoughts and feelings inside her that can't be erased by her creators, just felt like one suspension of disbelief too far for me.",9.0,5,6,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8851401805877686}",Positive
The Wild Robot,Joining the pantheon of greatest animated films!,"Watching this great children's movie (written & directed by Chris Sanders, from a beloved kids' book penned by Pete Brown), I began to think about those other animated films that I've truly treasured over my adult years: about 30 years ago, there was the first Toy Story (voiced by Tom Hanks), then first Shrek (with Mike Myers), Finding Nemo (starring Albert Brooks), etc. Now DreamWorks gives us another true treasure for 2024, and it's named ""The Wild Robot,"" with the titular character, Roz, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o. A dozen other great voice actors (Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Ving Rhames, Stephanie Hsu, Matt Berry and Mark Hamill among them) are also featured, and Maren Morris sings the opening and closing them songs. The robot in question crash lands on an island inhabited solely by wild animals, including a huge bear (Rhames), beaver (Berry), sly fox (Pascal), geese (Nighy), skunks and raccoons, even a family of opossums. By enabling its intelligent learning capability, it is taught all of the languages of these animals and proceeds to communicate with them all. The robot develops feelings for the animal species, especially the gosling born soon after the robot crash landing had crushed its mother. Roz, our robot, will eventually raise the young bird and teach it to fly to facilitate its winter migration. ""We may sometimes have to learn to actually do things beyond what we are programmed to do."" More important than those skills she imparts, is the fact that she learns what love is and means!

The Wild Robot,"An absolute pleasure, not to be missed","Despite practically universal acclaim from critics and viewers alike, I admit that I was in no rush to check this out, and in the first minutes the flick didn't make any major impression. It doesn't take long, however, before 'The wild robot' begins to prove itself, and I am delighted by how thoroughly enjoyable it is. Once additional characters are meaningfully introduced to complement Roz, the humor and storytelling take on new dimensions, and the result is fun, satisfying, and rewarding in exactly the fashion we want out of movies, and modern animation not least. I might stop a little short of saying that this totally demands viewership, but in every regard the film is so immensely pleasing, and outright fulfilling, and I could scarcely recommend it any more highly.

What here is not to love? Powered by DreamWorks, the visual experience is as tremendously beautiful and dazzling as we could hope. Character designs are built from familiar conceptions, between robot Roz and the wildlife that surrounds her, but given forms that are reliably new and creative in at least some small way - including not least the body language, facial expressions, and other cues corresponding to emotional beats. From lighting, water, weather, and other effects to the utterly gorgeous environment (somewhat recalling the magnificence we see in recent 'Legend of Zelda' games 'Breath of the wild' or 'Tears of the kingdom'), the fundamental appearance of every sight to greet us is plainly terrific. And this is only only more so for how this takes some influence from other recent animation, namely DreamWork's own 'Puss in Boots: The last wish,' which infuses some shrewd 2D flavoring, and smart texture and detail, into the predominant 3D style. That the animals in this are so goshdarn cute, well, that's just a bonus.

There are some very noteworthy names attached to this picture to help bring it to life, and I don't even mean filmmaker Chris Sanders, he behind 'Lilo & Stitch' and 'How to train your dragon.' Lupita Nyong'o is a joy in the unexpectedly dynamic performance she gives as Roz, and hardly any less so co-stars like Pedro Pascal, Ving Rhames, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Stephanie Hsu, and many others as they lend their voices. Kris Bowers' original score tends to stick to the background, but is nonetheless superb accompaniment to the proceedings at all times; more than that, at precise psychological moments, Bowers latches onto the emotional heft of the tale with just the right chords, and the outcome is deeply gratifying, including in the last act as the course of events bounds toward its climax. The same, it should be said, goes for the original songs performed by Maren Morris, namely ""Kiss the sky."" As the feature further benefits from impeccable sound, keen editing and cinematography, and mindful, attentive direction, all the pieces are in place for the flick to take flight and soar on its on power.

Of course, none of this necessarily matters if the writing isn't up to snuff. Yet while I confess I'm unfamiliar with Peter Brown's books, there is no question in my mind that Sanders' adaptation stands firmly on its own legs, and is ultimately even better than I expected. Throughout its 100-odd minutes the title touches upon a lot more concretely dramatic beats amidst the adventure blended with science fiction, but there is plentiful humor all along the way of varying natures - some of it very family-friendly, some downright silly, and some more subtly wry or dark, yet pretty much all of it decidedly sharp and witty. Through it all, 'The wild robot' can claim such incredible heart and earnestness that it plays on our emotions again and again, above all with the mindful, thoughtful themes that the narrative embraces. Strong characterizations, robust scene writing, and wonderfully bright dialogue help to cement notions of parenthood generally, and motherhood specifically; community, found family, and coming together to survive emergencies and grave threats; growing up both physically and emotionally, and discovering one's own potential; and still more. This movie runs the gamut as ROZZUM 7134 awakens on an island uninhabited by humans and encounters local fauna, but Sanders' screenplay weaves it all together so smoothly that the sum total amounts to a viewing experience that's all but stunning for how it touches us.

In the strictest of terms I'm not sure that this is entirely perfect. In very broad strokes - the passage of time, and the narrative flow from beginning to end - it sometimes feels as if the pacing is a tad too swift, in turn failing to fully capitalize on the weight of some beats. Furthermore, even for as great as Sanders' writing is, there are some ideas herein that may be a tad too out of character with the remainder, chiefly with sequences that notably expand the sci-fi horizons of the story, which lean heavily into action ideations, or which even border on sci-fi horror. I wonder if it's not the case that the script could have been trimmed a little, with some material left for the sequel that Sanders is reportedly developing. The film is complete, cohesive, and stupendously compelling, but also maybe ever so slightly a bit much.

Then again, for as fantastic as this is in truly every capacity, and for as much as it successfully and meaningfully tugs on the heartstrings - and for as impactful and relevant as its themes are - any imperfections don't really count for all that much when all is said and done. I maintain that 'The wild robot' isn't necessarily an essential must-see, yet for the stellar level on which it operates in regards to its animation, the voice acting, the music, its technical craft, and perhaps above all its writing, it would be a sore mistake to pass up any opportunity to watch. Take it from someone who for reasons I can't explain was marginally indifferent or even hesitant to watch: this picture is a real pleasure, something that everyone could appreciate and from which anyone can take away honest substance, and all the high praise it has garnered since its release is right on point. 'The wild robot' is exceptional, and I'm thrilled to give it my very high, hearty, and enthusiastic recommendation!",10.0,0,0,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'cinematography', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9687076210975647}",Positive
The Wild Robot,The year's best animation. Already a classic.,"""Sometimes, to survive, you must become more than you were programmed to be."" Roz (voice of Lupita Nyong'o)

The Wild Robot may be the best animation this year, and that's considering the estimable Inside Out 2. While Robot contains most of the motifs and tropes of classic animations from Pixar, Ghibli, et al., DreamWorks weaves them easily through an endearing story about smart robot Roz bonding with the wild animals of a remote island, especially a wily fox named Fink (voice of Pedro Pascal). At a time now when the AI revolution is questioned, this fable is a welcome contribution to the argument that AI will be a welcomed addition to the human journey.

The bonds are reflective of the very human story, adapted from Peter Brown's series about the need for cooperation to overcome adversity and love to make life worth living. These motifs are important enough to make the artificiality of talking animals and exotic aliens believable, largely because the ideas come from sincere characters not driven by greed, but striving to survive over winter and the invasion of dangerous robots. And all this humanity has rarely a human in sight.

The backgrounds are animation lush, painterly like those of Miyazaki, and maybe that's its charm because the story and its messages are tied to character and visuals. As the story progresses, the action is ramped up to satisfy those who want explosions and villainy. The runt goose, Brightbill (voice of Kit Connor), abides through it all even though he ""was never supposed to make it this far,"" says Longneck (voice of Bill Nighy). He best of all represents the resilience of Nature, and by figurative extension, humans.

In other words, The Wild Robot, seemingly influenced by Brad Bird's classic The Iron Giant, has everything to satisfy animation freaks and story tyrants. Its heroine has the best of human emotions, encouraging love and cooperation, traits the Mideast and American politics should seize in their quest for peace.",,7,12,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'visual', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9410380721092224}",Positive
The Wild Robot,Love is all things.....,"8.6/10 (Highly Recommend)

A wonderful film that shows the strongest powers of love.... When a robot named Roz winds up a random island with creatures she can't understand. She begins a protocol to learn how to understand them, and with enough motivation a beautiful relationship is born.

This is an absolutely outstanding film that is a must see in theatres. The actors to voice Roz and the animals is perfect. There's a lot of emotions to this film, and it gently talks about losing someone you love without all the darkness.

There's some good moments where you'll laugh, and there may be some moments where a tear is jerking from your eye, but in the end it's all about acceptance. The underlying tone of the film is that it doesn't matter if you're different, love can conquer all.

This is definitely a film you need to experience in theatres. Just for the visuals and the music. You don't necessarily need to see it in 3D or anything like that, but to capture the emotions properly I definitely think theatres.

The whole family can enjoy this. While there was a moment or two of slight adult humour it is a clean movie. It doesn't exasperate being naughty or dirty. It's truly a film about love and acceptance and that's about as much as I can say that won't give away anything.

The Wild Robot,One of The Greatest Animated Films Ever Made,"This movie is absolutely phenomenal, and it is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. Before going into it, I was aware of the crazy good reviews, and I thought ""there's no way it's THAT good."" I was so happy to be proven wrong. It IS that good. Dreamworks has outdone themselves entirely with this one. It's easily their best movie. I don't know if this movie will ever be surpassed.

Firstly, the animation is unimaginably beautiful. Every scene looks like it could be put into a picture frame and then placed into a museum. Normally animation is ironically the last thing I look at when watching an animated movie, but it's just too good to overlook here. It really makes every scene incredibly better. Second, it's extremely emotional and tense. I had no clue a film could have such a basic plot and still have the most heavy-hitting and beautifully emotional scenes in cinema. Lastly, the character development is insanely good. Despite the fast pace of the film, every single character gets their own room to grow, which is extremely impressive considering how many characters there are.

The Wild Robot,Magnificent Survival Story of Two Different Worlds,"As of this weekend, Dreamworks Animation has released their final feature to be animated fully in house called The Wild Robot, based on the children's book by Peter Brown. Written & directed by Chris Sanders of Lilo & Stitch and Croods fame, the film has currently garnered strong critical acclaim yet weak financial returns. Over the years, children's books have proven to be strong staples for Dreamworks, with the likes of Shrek, How to Train your Dragon and The Bad Guys being definitive gems in the studio's lineup. And with a bold storyteller like Sanders helming this project, how well did it turn out in the end?

The film follows a robot named ROZZUM 7314 (or ""Roz"") who gets shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, and learns to adapt to her surroundings. Upon becoming the adoptive mother of an orphaned gosling, Roz grows accustomed to the wildlife as a new home. As a fish out of water narrative, The Wild Robot is presented through the eyes of an outsider not programmed for a place they end up in. Because Roz is programmed for assistance, her mechanical determination to find any task to complete in the forest leads to humorous and life threatening results, and Lupita Nyong'o manages to convey a lot of nuanced enthusiasm through the robot's programmed demeanor. One of the film's many recurring themes is the concept of death, which suits the nature setting as a welcoming planetary attribute that can still kill you. As Roz faces the challenge of raising a gosling, Brown's theme of kindness being used for survival is executed through sincere appreciation towards the development of life & death, something that has become forgotten in mainstream animation.

In addition to Roz encountering a lot of rambunctious animals in the remote wildlife, her acquaintances range from the cynical albeit lonely fox Fink (Pedro Pascal), the tough mother opossum Pinktail (Catherine O'Hara), the seemingly volatile grizzly bear named Thorn (Mark Hamill), and the snobbish beaver Paddler (Matt Berry). By spending just enough time with these characters as they adapt to their world, Roz and Brightbill grow further in their conflicting yet emotionally captivating relationship. While having the animals talk can lead to a lot of unnecessary dialogue, especially with the much younger characters at bay, it does work in establishing the intent communication between two different worlds: one futuristic and one preservational. Plus, many of these characters allow for some much needed levity in such a heavy thematic story humor, especially as the plot leads to Roz's own existence being threatened with unwilling compromise. It's this healthy balance of naturalistic humor and intense survival that make the cast worth engaging with regardless of their backgrounds.

As a genuine passion project from Brown and Sanders, the intended combination of Monet and Studio Ghibli inspired artistry paints the movie with a genuine painterly direction in terms of scope and scale. On top of the characters reflecting their real life animal counterparts, the animators captured their personalities divinely and the approach in keeping Roz's physical actions primary allows us as the viewers to relate to her on a human level. The brushstroke aesthetic compliments the cold color palette with rewarding lighting and effects work, almost as if the well crafted art direction can also be witnessed without the sound on, especially when the film lets the scenery do the talking instead of the dialogue. Lastly, the propulsive score by Kris Bowers further enhances the scenery and stakes afloat, and the few background songs that accompany certain sequences blend surprisingly well with the emotional core set in stone. It's so rare to see a mainstream animated feature made with such pristine dedication to the art form, let alone one made for general audiences.

By telling a riskful engaging story about learning beyond what you're brought up to do, The Wild Robot is a simple tale told with passionate sophistication and a beautiful artistry. Much like how some parents raise their children by following their hearts, this movie successfully pays tribute to the emotional bonding found in familial development. If you're looking for a new family film to tackle mature subject matter towards almost all ages, then this is a must watch for the fall season. This film might mark the end of an era for Dreamworks, but they managed to leave their in-house features on a powerful high note.",9.0,3,5,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7279136180877686}",EMPTY
The Wild Robot,Ros voice very underwhelming,"The film is visually stunning as many people say, but from the beginning I found the voice for the robot so distracting like it was being read at a first read through or something. I know it's a robot, but there was just no passion or delivery even in the voice that made me warm to the character or what they were saying at all. It spoilt what otherwise would be a great movie.

I just kept really hearing her ""read* the script in front of her as though she didn't understand the character she was playing, or decide on a route to take it.

Praise has flowered in for Dreamworks' strongest outing in years from all angles and while by every technical measure Wild Robot is stunning, there's a deceptive complex airing beneath the template story that I can't see young'uns grasping. The pacing is also whack - this could be hand waved off by the animation being consistently ovational, even plodding narrative beats will still plod - at least for the opening, as even by the time it mellows out in the midsection so much plot happens in a story that's relatively little league.

The Wild Robot,A brilliant animated film that touches the heart,"""The Wild Robot,"" the new gem from DreamWorks, has emerged as one of the most emotional and profound animated films of the year. This story introduces us to a world where technology and nature collide, but not to clash-rather, to discover an unexpected harmony. The film tells the journey of a robot that, after being shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, must adapt to his new wild surroundings, facing his own physical and emotional limits.

Introduction: Adapting to a hostile environment at the start of the film, the robot, initially programmed only for technical tasks and without emotional capacity, finds himself lost and disoriented in a completely unfamiliar environment. On this island, governed by the natural food chain, the animals don't accept him right away, seeing him as an outsider. However, in his quest to survive and find his place in this new world, the robot discovers something unexpected: the ability to feel and form bonds beyond his initial programming.

Development: The rise of emotions over time, the robot begins to forge connections with the island's inhabitants, especially with a small orphaned ghostling, which he decides to raise as if it were his own. This relationship becomes the emotional core of the film. Through his bond with the ghostling and other animals, the robot begins to experience human-like emotions such as affection, fear of loss, and compassion. DreamWorks masterfully shows how, in a wild environment, this mechanical being develops an inner alliance, transforming into a creature capable of love and care.

Conclusion: Unity and harmony between species as the film progresses, the robot not only adapts but also plays a crucial role in creating a harmonious community on the island. Together, the animals and the robot form a kind of society where they coexist and support each other, breaking the barriers between technology and nature. However, the film also reminds us that, despite the bonds formed, the natural cycle of life continues its course. ""The Wild Robot"" leaves us with a profound reflection on the connection between all living beings, showing that even in an unforgiving wilderness, unity and love can flourish.

In short, ""The Wild Robot"" is a film that transcends the animation genre to tell a universal story about adaptability, love, and creating bonds beyond differences. With impeccable artistic direction and a narrative that touches deep emotions, it is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year-a tale full of beauty and depth that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of its viewers.",9.0,2,3,fear,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'technology', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.922562301158905}",Positive

The Wild Robot,Simple Yet Incredibly Moving,"The Wild Robot is a film that I was curious about. DreamWorks has had a very mixed reception with their animated catalogue with Puss In Boots: The Last Wish being the last good movie from the studio 2 years ago. So imagine my surprise when I saw this movie being called ""DreamWorks Best Movie Yet"" following its TIFF premiere. And now that I've watched it I kinda agree with this statement.

First of all, the animation is truly stunning. From the gorgeous brush strokes, the smooth movements to the lush and detailed depiction of the island it feels like a watercolor painting come to life. One of the most visually compelling animated feature I've seen in a while. The score by Kris Bowers is so epic and soothing that perfectly fits the tone of the film. The characters are endearing and have great arcs particularly the Wild Robot, Roz, the fox, Fink and the goose, Brightbill. These three make for an iconic trio that it's hard not to fall in love with them. Speaking of which, the voice performances are stellar particularly from Lupita Nyong'o as Roz and Pedro Pascal as Fink.

But beyond all of this, there comes the story, which is simple and straightforward and yet is so moving. It seamlessly balances it's light and funny moments with the more tense and emotional ones. On the surface the story is about a service robot who was shipwrecked on an island and tries to survive and form bonds with the animals in this new environment, but there are more deeper layers to it. It's about familial love, friendship and unity and how even the coldest of beings learns to love and care for others.

Overall, The Wild Robot is beautiful, heartwarming and emotional. The story is simple yet is powerfully moving and it all comes to life through lavish visuals and an epic soundtrack. This an adventure that'll stick with you long after the movie ends.

The Wild Robot,"Honestly, keep your kids away from this","For me, all qualities the movie may have had were lost in the lengthy use of macabre language at the beginning.

The constant and repetitive question ""are you here to kill us?"", split apart by the repetition of words like ""kill"", ""die"", ""dead"", ""hate"", ""jerk"", ""murder"" as others have mentioned, and humor based on a barrage of violent behavior killed the mood for me. Nothing that came after was enjoyable despite any qualities it may had because it changed my mood.

Unless society is assuming that violence has become a staple for kids entertainment and that subjecting the younger ones to enjoy violence is good, I cannot understand how the studio could find this appropriate.

If the movie is not intended for young kids, than the story is very weak, basic and done a million times, both in animation as in regular movies.

Movie Review: The Wild Robot

I didn't expect much out of The Wild Robot, but I was genuinely amazed by how deep and impactful it turned out to be. This isn't just a story about a robot-it's a beautifully layered film filled with emotions, love, and universal messages. The script is incredibly well done, complemented by stunning visuals and a captivating soundtrack that pulls you into the heart of the story.

Roz's transformation in the wilderness is at the core of the movie's charm. It's inspiring to see how she adapts, building connections with the creatures around her. The film conveys that kindness can be a mode of survival, yet it's driven by values, beliefs, and, ultimately, love. This message is both touching and thought-provoking, showing us the power of empathy and the importance of connection.

I'd definitely recommend The Wild Robot to anyone. It's suitable for all ages, from kids to adults, and it carries a simple, clear message that anyone can relate to. This movie is a gem that's sure to leave a lasting impression.",9.0,1,1,surprise,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9663428664207458}",Positive

The Wild Robot,"""The Wild Robot"": A Beautifully Crafted Story About Parenthood","""The Wild Robot"" is a standout Dreamworks project that has captivated audiences with its wholesome and sincere approach to storytelling. The film shines through its realistic depiction of life in the wild, as it doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of nature. It explores the prey-predator relationship, migration, and the challenges of extreme weather. These mature themes are presented in a way that helps kids understand the complexities of life in the wild.

At its heart, the film is a simple yet substantial story. It isn't just about finding a home; it's about creating one for yourself and those around you. The film beautifully demonstrates how migration can be essential for survival and how letting go can sometimes be a form of protection for ourselves and our loved ones. On a deeper level, when you look at these characters and dissect the people they represent. Brightbill, Fink, and Roz each represent a fundamental aspect of the human journey, and in doing so, they resonate with the core of who we are and the paths we choose.

Brightbill, the goose that grew up being nurtured by a robot and the fox, represents those people who feel an innate pull towards their origin. Some people who were raised in an environment unlike their own are on their journey of self-discovery and belonging. Others tend to go their way and find those people who share their passions and understand the nuances and experiences of their lives. It is not about rejecting the people or community that raised them; it's about seeking solace and understanding those who share the same belief and mirror their spirit. Just as the geese migrate in order to survive, some people also search for their own flock and tribe to feel truly at home and survive.

Fink, the solitary fox, represents those people who find peace in solitude, which is often misunderstood by society. In a society where we label these people as outsiders, Fink is a testament to the quiet strength found in being alone and enjoying your own company. Some people feel like they are lone wanderers, perceived by society as distant or ""monsters"" as what they call the fox, yet they find comfort in the silence and learning to coexist with the people around them. Fink reminds us that walking alone is okay and that solitude can be a friend rather than a foe.

Lastly, we have Roz, the robot who leaves behind what she knows to protect those around her. Roz's journey is all about sacrifices and courage, stepping beyond the familiar to ensure the safety of those she loves. It's a poignant reminder that there are also people who had to make this difficult decision in life, leaving behind the comfort and familiarity of the place they knew for the sake of those they hold dear. Their path is not easy and often misunderstood by those around them, but it's a powerful narrative of love and protection that sometimes leaving can be a form of protection.

Each of these characters reflects our own lives and choices. Whether we seek our people like Brightbill, find peace in solitude like Fink, or make sacrifices like Roz, we are all navigating the complex journey of existence in our own unique ways. There is no right or wrong path, only the one that feels true to who we are.

Staying faithful to the source material, Dreamworks has elevated the story by avoiding unnecessary complications, focusing instead on heartfelt and sincere storytelling. They may not have been consistent in recent years in giving us quality animations, but with the power of Chris Sanders, ""The Wild Robot"" has managed to salvage the studio. The film is a poignant exploration of parenthood, survival, and kindness, offering a warm embrace to those who are motherless or parentless. Its charm lies not in a complex plot but in its ability to explore mature themes in a way that children and adults can easily reach.

Lupita Nyong'o delivers a standout performance as the voice actor of Roz the Robot, bringing nuances of a robot and warmth to the character. The animation is breathtaking, capturing the beauty and brutality of the wild with stunning detail, with each character being part of this beautifully immersive world that the animation department expertly crafts. With Chris Sanders behind the camera, a legend in animation, ""The Wild Robot"" emerges as one of the best-animated films of the year, surpassing my much-anticipated ""Inside Out 2."" It's a film that knows how to make the audiences laugh, cry, and affect them with simplicity and aptitude.

To sum it all up, ""The Wild Robot"" is a testament to the power of simple yet earnest storytelling. It's a film that touches the heart while imparting valuable lessons to its audiences. Whether you're a child or simply a child at heart, this film offers something truly special-a reminder that sometimes, the simplest stories are the ones that stay with us the longest.",9.0,1,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8284000158309937}",Positive
The Wild Robot,A Stunning and Emotional Journey - A Future DreamWorks Classic,"10/10

I recently watched The Wild Robot with my brother, and we were absolutely blown away. As two 30-year-olds who love a good animation, this film ticked every box and then some. The animation is stunning-vibrant colors and breathtaking visuals that immediately pull you into its world. The story is both moving and profound, balancing moments of happiness and emotional depth in a way that few films manage to achieve.

Kudos to Hiphop Thamizha for choosing this subject. The political one lines and some satire apocalypse dialogs are ultimate. ""Manitham, saga manithan"" wow.

Natraj is so opt and has equal role to the hero. He shined both first and second half of the movie. The first half is current politics and the second half is imminent and we are moving fast towards it.

The film isn't flawless; after watching many Hollywood productions, a few scenes seem absurd. Additionally, the hero has easy access to everything in the second half, which adds a little more masala flavor. This is definitely a commendable attempt in Tamil cinema, given the small (own) budget and the forgiveness of these writings shortcomings.

You could have removed the murderer and created a story where she had to choose between saving her sister from a car accident knowing that she would not be born if she did.

There was not really any sense of urgency or suspense in the film that you would expect even for a poorly made horror film. SONR is just a company that somehow had something to do with inventing a time machine. We are not even offered any explanation.

Omni Loop,This movie is gonna get a lot of undeserved hate for not being what people want it to be.,"First off, let me give an honest up front detail about my review process: This film is really a 7.5 to me, but i rounded up instead of down like i usually do, because i feel this movie is trapped between a rock and a hard place.

This is NOT an action, or adventure film, at all, like most big Sci-fi. Kinda barely even a sci-fi film, I prefer to call it Speculative Fiction, but most of all its a drama, while also not being exactly what that implies. This movie isn't a ""Family drama"" but it does focus in on familial bonds, its definitely not a comedy, but it stars relatable comic actors who inject a bit of levity into the situations. Its not any of those genres But it has elements of them all. (except, to be clear, action and adventure).

To me this belongs in a genre I really love that I'm calling ""Meta-Modern Speculative Fiction"", and the easiest comparison is basically ALL the films of Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Synecdoche NY, Being John Malkovich), but others that I've loved are: Visioneers, Donnie Darko, Southland Tales, Sorry to Bother You, The Lobster, Poor Things, Get Out, Nope and the Tv Shows Legion, The Last Man on Earth, Maniac, I am a Virgo, and Devs. I could list a ton more but im getting away from the point.

All this type of media tends to take a Speculative fiction concept, usually with some surreal mystery/thriller element, and apply those to a character drama, with a philosophical and/or psychosocial tone. They tend to defy genre convention by combining Elements of those genres and others, and an often wildly oscillating emotional undertone, conjuring disparate negative and positive associations along the way.

In this case its mostly a time travel character drama, a little mystery thriller, and a peppering of other momentary vibes. It obviously shares a lot of tropes with Groundhog day but it tackles those in a totally different way that fans of Time Travel narratives will appreciate because it compresses a lot of the classic moments with clever editing techniques that fans of film editing will also love.

Give it a watch if that sounds good, and if you already but you were expecting a different movie, please don't rate it poorly because it didn't match expectation, a lot of people like me want to see movies like this, and when the weirder movies tend to get downvoted due to being misunderstood it just gets tougher to find and support films like this.",8.0,67,36,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.776436448097229}",EMPTY

Omni Loop,A Brilliant Film,"Possessing profound philosophical, metaphysical and theoretical scientific knowledge can provide us with unique insights into the nature of existence and how reality comes into being, and aspiring to the attainment of that wisdom is undoubtedly a noble and worthwhile goal. But, in all truthfulness, what good is that knowledge if we lack the practical, plainspoken common sense to know what to do with it, particularly when it comes to shaping the destinies of our own lives? Does such a lofty objective truly lead to meaningful satisfaction and genuine fulfillment? Those are the questions faced by fifty-something writer and scientist Zoya Lowe (Mary-Louise Parker) when confronting her impending mortality, an outcome she's successfully been able to circumvent by employing novel means to avoid it. The catch, however, is that she can only use these enigmatic measures to rewind the clock of her life by a week, a pattern that keeps repeating nearly identically in each case. They may help her stave off death, but do they produce an innately satisfying result? And why can she only go back in time for one week - why not longer and why not past the same end point in each case? After becoming bored with this endlessly repeating scenario, she decides to pursue a different course by launching an investigation into the mechanics of time travel with the aid of an ambitious laboratory assistant (Ayo Edibiri) with whom she has an unexpected chance encounter. However, once their work begins, they come no closer to finding a solution, prompting Zoya to engage in some heavy-duty introspection about such issues as did she make the most of her life up to the start of her final fateful week and what, in fact, constitutes the nature of bona fide corporeal fulfillment? Indeed, she must ask herself, what really matters in life and does her extensive knowledge truly help her understand it? Writer-director Bernardo Britto packs a great deal of genuinely thoughtful material into this intelligently conceived, smartly written, at times poetic story that explores heady sci-fi topics from an intensely personal, extremely intimate standpoint, something rarely seen in films from this genre. It accomplishes this without relying on an abundance of glitzy special effects, instead employing some of the most effective film editing I've ever seen, presenting vivid imagery with dazzling, dramatic, rapid-fire precision to captivate audiences and hold viewer attention. It also features what's arguably Parker's best on-screen performance, revealing a dynamic range of emotions from joy to sadness to vulnerability not often seen in characters in narratives such as this. There's a fair amount of well-placed comic relief, too, inspired by the narratives of films like ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) but without being an obvious copycat. Admittedly, the picture drags a bit at times in the second half (at least by comparison to the sustained frenetic pace of its opening act), but that's more than made up for by the emotionally affecting closing sequence, one that's sure to melt viewers' hearts. ""Omni Loop"" is unlike most other science fiction offerings that most of us have probably seen, but it's one well worth a look, especially for the lingering impressions it's likely to leave on us and the soul searching it's destined to prompt, considerations we should all bear in mind when it comes to the lives we create for ourselves, undertakings that we should strive to handle skillfully, with a sense of joy and an aim for achieving the greatest degree of fulfillment attainable.",9.0,29,52,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,negative,negative,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7910605669021606}",EMPTY

Deadpool & Wolverine,"A very meta, very inside joke of a movie","I had to do a lot of reading before I could understand what was going on in this movie. The backstory is that Marvel Comics made a bunch of movies with 20th Century Fox before (and after) Marvel Studios was founded and launched the ""MC Universe"" with ""Iron Man"". Some of the Fox/Marvel movies were successful (the X-Men series, and the two Deadpool movies) while some were not (Daredevil, Fantastic Four). Then Disney acquired both Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox. Disney decided to focus and build on the MCU, leaving most of the Fox Marvel characters behind. But Deadpool and Wolverine are popular characters, and Disney doesn't want them to die.

This movie is a self-referential, meta satire of all of this corporate mishegas. Matthew McFayden plays a creepy corporate type that wants to get rid of all universes except ""the Sacred Timeline"" (i.e. The MCU). He summons Deadpool and offers him a place in the Sacred Timeline before Deadpool's world is destroyed. When Deadpool refuses and tries to enlist Wolverine's help to save his universe, they are exiled to ""the Void"", which is populated by forgotten or failed superheroes (including some funny cameos with famous movie stars reprising old roles that they would probably like the world to forget).

It all feels like too much of an inside joke to me. If you are a superhero aficionado, you will get most of the jokes. If you are more of a casual fan, you will have to look up a bunch of stuff on IMBD to avoid being thoroughly confused.",6.0,27,14,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.48345670104026794}",EMPTY

However, by the time the film reaches the second and third acts, the excessive swearing starts to wear thin.

The cinematography is excellent, with stunning color grading and a mix of close-ups and medium shots that are visually appealing. The editing also deserves praise, as it effectively enhances the humor and overall flow of the film. The costume and production design are both top-notch. The locations are beautifully chosen.

Deadpool & Wolverine,"Somethings work really well, others feel forced","Deadpool and Wolverine"" attempts to fuse the beloved irreverence of the Deadpool franchise with the rich emotional depth of the Wolverine character. While the film ultimately succeeds in many areas, it falters where humor should reign supreme. I found myself laughing far less than I expected. The humor, while crucial to the essence of the franchise, often felt forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to get the audience to laugh. I also felt the same way with the previous tow instalments.

However, this is where Hugh Jackman shines as Wolverine. He brings a gravitas to the role that perfectly complements the chaos that surrounds him. Jackman plays it straight throughout, grounding the film and providing a powerful character arc that resonates deeply. Returning to the role after ""Logan,"" I was eager to see how he'd be integrated into the zany world of Deadpool, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it all came together. His journey adds a layer of depth that balances Deadpool's antics, making their dynamic genuinely enjoyable.

The movie leans heavily on cameos, a choice that could easily backfire, as seen in other recent comedies. Thankfully, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" avoids this pitfall, ensuring that each cameo serves a purpose and contributes to the narrative rather than distracts from it. Each character's short appearances come with their own little arcs, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall story.

On the action front, the film excels. Each set piece is meticulously crafted, with choreography that ramps up from one impressive sequence to the next. The final moments, underscored by a Madonna soundtrack, serve as a fitting and stylish conclusion that encapsulates the film's playful tone while delivering a satisfying payoff.

Despite my appreciation for Jackman and the film's structural strengths, Ryan Reynolds' performance left me wanting. While I recognize he is irreplaceable in his role as Deadpool, it felt as though the humor sometimes fell flat, giving more of a sense of a comedian trying to be funny rather than effortlessly eliciting laughter. His delivery occasionally felt forced.

In terms of plot, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" does a decent job weaving a narrative that calls back to previous films while also paving the way for exciting new directions, primarily revolving around Deadpool's quest to convince Wolverine to step up and save the multiverse. The stakes feel significant, which adds weight to an otherwise outrageous film.

In conclusion, while ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" may not deliver the riotous laughter I expected, it provides a thoughtfully crafted experience enriched by Jackman's performance and an impressive escalation of action.

Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have both become synonymous with their respective roles, bringing unique and compelling performances that have resonated deeply with audiences.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is known for his irreverent humor, breaking the fourth wall, and his anti-hero charm. Reynolds' portrayal is consistently sharp, witty, and perfectly captures the essence of the Merc with a Mouth. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, on the other hand, has become iconic over the years, blending gruff intensity with a deep sense of vulnerability. Jackman's embodiment of Logan is both fierce and poignant, offering a depth to the character that has made him a beloved figure in the superhero genre.

Their on-screen chemistry is electric, blending Deadpool's chaotic, over-the-top antics with Wolverine's stoic, no-nonsense demeanor. This dynamic promises to deliver a unique blend of action, humor, and emotional depth. The reunion is not just a treat for fans but a celebration of two characters who have significantly impacted the superhero landscape.

The anticipation surrounding their interaction is immense, with fans eager to see how their contrasting personalities and fighting styles will mesh. The film is expected to be a perfect mix of humor, heart, and high-octane action, with both actors bringing their A-game to the table.

Overall, the reunion of Deadpool and Wolverine is shaping up to be a cinematic event that highlights the strengths of both characters and the actors who portray them. It is a testament to the enduring popularity of these two heroes and the incredible performances that have brought them to life on the big screen.",10.0,5,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9747470617294312}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,"""Deadpool & Wolverine: A Parfect Match Made in R-Rated Heaven""","Last night i watched Deadpool & Wolverine and i must say film is must watch. I watched previous two Deadpool films and other Marvel film's in its original language but my friend recommended me to watch this movie in Hindi Dub and I must say dubbing was actually very good. Hindi Dialogues perfectly match in comedic situation and audience laughing all the time in theatre.

Deadpool & Wolverine is an explosive, hilarious, and action-packed ride that perfectly blends the irreverent humor of Deadpool with the brooding intensity of Wolverine. This film is a testament to the power of chemistry, as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman share an undeniable on-screen camaraderie that elevates the entire experience.

The film masterfully balances its comedic and action-packed elements. Deadpool's signature fourth-wall-breaking antics and witty one-liners are as sharp as ever, while Wolverine's raw power and berserker rage provide a thrilling counterbalance. The action sequences are choreographed with precision and are visually stunning, but it's the comedic timing and banter between the two protagonists that truly sets this film apart.

While the film pays homage to the characters' comic book origins, it also manages to offer fresh perspectives on both Deadpool and Wolverine. We see a more vulnerable side to Wolverine, while Deadpool's chaotic energy is dialed up to eleven. The dynamic between the two characters is constantly evolving, keeping the audience engaged and entertained.

The fight sequences in Deadpool & Wolverine are a breathtaking blend of brutal efficiency and comic book absurdity. Wolverine's feral, animalistic fighting style is juxtaposed with Deadpool's chaotic, unpredictable approach, creating a visually stunning and exhilarating spectacle. The cinematography during these sequences is nothing short of exceptional. Rapid cuts, slow-motion, and dynamic camera angles capture the intensity and chaos of the fights, immersing the audience in the action. The use of handheld cameras adds a gritty, realistic feel, while the incorporation of Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking commentary provides a unique and humorous twist.

The music score for Deadpool & Wolverine is a masterclass in balancing contrasting tones. The action sequences are accompanied by a pulsating, adrenaline-fueled score that perfectly complements the on-screen mayhem. The use of heavy metal and industrial elements adds to the raw intensity of the fights. On the other hand, during the comedic moments, the score is lighthearted and playful, often incorporating unexpected musical choices that enhance the humor.

The cinematography in Deadpool & Wolverine is a character in itself. The film boasts a vibrant, comic book-inspired visual style that is both visually appealing and functionally effective. The use of color is bold and striking, with the red and yellow color palette of Deadpool's costume serving as a focal point.

While the film is largely a triumph, there are a few minor issues. The plot, while entertaining, is somewhat predictable at times. Additionally, some of the comedic gags might not land for everyone, as the humor is sometimes crude and irreverent.

Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a must-see for fans of the characters and action-comedy genre. It's a film that delivers on all fronts, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart.",8.0,5,3,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9868558049201965}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,Welcome to Marvel's wrecked and broken universe,"I was a real growing fan of Deadpool movies. The first was absolutely brilliant and the second followed, so why in this one I feel such a big miss? Its not that the jokes became less funny or Reynolds is not giving all he's got for the ticket you bought, but something was missing and that includes his relationship with one - Hugh Jackman.

I can bluntly say what it is that is sitting in the back of my head. The relationship with marvel and the repeatability of the same concept once again to the level it doesn't cracks me up. I will know that to expect and though the team up promises something extra, you still get the feeling that you've seen it all and there is nothing new to give.

It's perfect for the trilogy to extinct itself while joining marvel's ranks. It's the effect they have on all that is good and once was the MCU. You need to study hard to align and to be a fanatic fan not to miss any small detail, cameo or any Easter egg that they are laying on your silly head.

Seems that nothing will make Marvell's collapsing process to stop, not even their new Mashiach recruit or him teaming up with the classic version of the Wolverine. Nothing can stop the process and nothing can make this dying universe to rise above its difficulties and mediocre level - not even the golden laying goose of Fox - Deadpool.

Hugh Jackman seems like he was forced on the movie, as part of him being a great friend to Reynolds and their YouTube video gags. Jackman is not alone, as several other characters that I won't specify in order not to be hanged due to spoilers' reasons, are also in the movie with a Cameo show and nothing past it.

This movie is funny, but not compelling as its predecessors - it had good vibe, jokes and what not, but it continues not to surprise with the breaking of the fourth wall and feels like it won't be remembered a long time after it's done. No specific or coherent plot, what so ever and or any other luring elements except cameos and fun time on Fox's account.

The chemistry almost doesn't exist, because of the dynamics and nature of and between the main characters seems to tilt only to the side of Deadpool - feels like wolverine is in his own long cameo performance and waits to get out of his spandex and back to his grave. On the other side - who else can get into this suit and blades other the Jackman?

Though it is a lot of fun time and well performed action sequences, it is another good example that no need to dig out corps from their graves if you don't need to. Marvell seems to feel always they have to do those stuff so we're rolling with the flow, but this is most definitely not the best Deadpool show. He can wrap it up and try to move to other characters...yeah right...",6.0,3,4,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.786415696144104}",EMPTY
Deadpool & Wolverine,Breaking the 4th Wall,"Watched movie without taking Deadpool as serious character because he obviously isn't, but this sequel balance that part of wanting to matter as Marvel character and staying specific in presentation of what kind of character he is. Nobody takes him serious because of his behavior, so that starts to be a challenge for Deadpool. Meanwhile, while making that balance, there is a lot of punchlines, references, Easter eggs and ""talking"" to audience, so the accent of the movie was often breaking the 4th Wall, which I think is interesting, but not in that extent because it affected a story a lot and made it chaotic and sometimes without context. Anyway, it was fun to watch with friends and laugh a lot, enjoyed watching something different from Marvel and would like to see other characters to be a little not family friendly as it is Deadpool.",7.0,2,2,joy,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'aspect': 'character', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8564149141311646}",Positive

Deadpool and Wolverine are good used, the villian is not the best villian of Marvel, we already have Thanos and Ego but it's not a bad villian.

The worst thing is to over saturated the movie with cameo, and cameo, and cameo all over again until the movie finish you can breath and continue. Other aspect is that is the more vulgar movie that I see after ""Joker."" If Marvel want it to do it PG 13, the movie is to vulgar for being considerated.

Deadpool & Wolverine,"Trashy, violent entertainment for a sick society","I have purposely avoided the comic book genre of movies for the last few decades since I view them as infantile. Superpowers, extended battles, ridiculous physics (or lack thereof), binary good vs evil characters...perhaps if I were still a 10-year old boy I might enjoy that monotony. Of course there were some classics like 1989's Batman which elevated themselves beyond just a ""superhero"" movie. But I have been happy to ignore the deluge since that time.

Unfortunately I was dragged in to see this Deadpool / Wolverine abomination recently, and I feel compelled to express my dismay.

Yikes. Is this what the moviegoing public is cool with? Most of it is simply a series of extremely graphic mass murder sequences set to upbeat music, juvenile jokes (I didn't laugh once), swearing, and the usual ridiculous CGI jumping through dimensions or whatever. Whatever ""plot"" there was, I missed it because it was complete gibberish.

Yes, let's further desensitize ourselves to brutal violence by laughing at the murderous rampages. Are we supposed to be moved by the poetic arcs of blood and guts flying across the screen? Who is this for? Honestly, what kind of sick person *enjoys* this?

I'd feel cleaner coming out of a trashy strip club than this movie.

Deadpool & Wolverine,The most fascinating thing about this movie...,"It's a very entertaining movie, probably the best Deadpool movie in terms of balls and excitement. I mean the sheer balls to shear everyone in the balls.

Unfortunately these movies have a low ceiling for me. It's not something I'm going to be able to watch five, ten, twenty years from now and be like... OmG what a great movie, but i appreciate it for what it is.

That being said, the thing I enjoy most about this one over the other Deadpool movies is that it sort of highlights the process of studio development. The history of the the Marvel movies and their jostling about from one studio to the next has always been interesting to me and it's intriguing to see them work it into the storyline like this. Similar to how SpiderMan No Way Home brought in all the other Sony movies into its clutch, to see them do it with Fox makes it a really nice companion film in a way.

There were some notable surprises with the cameos and l'm really interested to hear the story of Marvel tapping Wesley Snipes to reprise Blade. Obviously there are a lot other actors who could've returned and I just want to know who's the selection process went about and if there were some who didn't make the cut or if some of the other actors were contacted and refused.

It all makes for good pop culture fodder. I just wonder if Marvel can keep up the intrigue for its next slate of releases or if this will end up being the final hoorah before the MCU finally meets its demise.

But let's talk about Cassandra Nova, who had the idea to kill her off? She's one of the best villains Marvel has created, she has so many layers, so much philosophy behind her and the movie just kills her off in the most boring way, she has so many stories to tell.

That was by far the best Deadpool from the 3. Fa far far.

Jackman still got the Wolverine up him. The oldies remembering the deardevil and Jennifer on her role there and Blade remembering the chars and the nostalgia oohhh. Channing also makes/made me wonder why a Gambit never popped in the theatre. And of course Evans on that role...omg Chris, picking up the pace at that point he showed up.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Team-up of the century,"Just when you thought superhero movies were dead, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy, and Hugh Jackman burst onto the scene with Deadpool and Wolverine, reigniting our excitement.

The plot is solid. Despite the numerous characters, none of them felt undeserved or in need of more screen time. Every gag and reference landed perfectly, and every jab at Fox, Disney, DC, and Marvel was both funny and true to Deadpool's character. The handling of Wolverine's return was particularly well done. The film managed to honor the legacy of the previous Logan without making his memory, sacrifice, or life seem redundant. Instead, it introduced a new Logan with a compelling backstory and strong character development, creating a narrative that stands on its own.

The inclusion of the TVA initially made me skeptical, especially since the tree wasn't shown. However, the reveal that this TVA outpost was run by a madman provided clarity and ensured that Loki's sacrifice and story were not undermined.

Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) had a compelling storyline. What made the film remarkable was its blend of resolving unfinished stories and introducing new ones, creating a harmonious narrative. While the TVA and Cassandra Nova's pursuit of Deadpool and Wolverine is a central plot, it does not dominate the film. Instead, you live and breathe each moment without wondering what's to come. The film offers an enjoyable ride filled with fun.

The only aspect that bothered me was how Deadpool and Wolverine survived after the final sacrifice scene. However, the film was so entertaining that I didn't mind this detail much. I was having too much fun enjoying every moment, so I'm going to let this go.

The beginning fight sequence where Deadpool is killing the TVA hunters was exceptionally well choreographed. The entire scene where he digs up the dead Wolverine only to realize that only the adamantium skeleton remains was hilariously fitting. It made perfect sense and had me thinking, ""What did I expect?"" Watching Deadpool kill the hunters using the adamantium bones and various body parts, and then trying to wield the claws only to get confused about how they work, was just too funny. It was the perfect intro to set the tone for the movie.

The backstory that follows is also well explained. The scene with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) where Wade wants to be an Avenger in the 616 (MCU) Timeline was fun. The banter and references were spot on and a delight to watch, and it was nice to see Happy again.

After getting captured by the TVA, Deadpool's reaction to seeing the Avengers on the screens and being star-struck, and just his time over there before he realized the actual motive was nice. The new suit, I must admit, looks fantastic.

The montage of Deadpool traveling to different timelines to find a replacement Wolverine was an absolute delight. Seeing different versions, like the shockingly short comic-accurate Wolverine, Wolverine fighting the Hulk, and even Henry Cavill as Wolverine, was so exciting and very well executed.

In the void, the half-buried logo of Fox Studios served as a clever snide at Disney buying Fox. The ensuing fight between Deadpool and Wolverine was both intense and satisfying.

Then, in a scene reminiscent of Mad Max, some old characters from the original X-Men movies, like Sabretooth and Azazel, make dramatic entrances in a desert setting. Just when you think that's all, Chris Evans appears. Everyone, including Deadpool, assumes he's Captain America, but then he says, ""Flame on,"" and I was like, let's go. He flies up and attacks the enemy but eventually loses the fight, which was hilarious.

After their capture, they are taken to Cassandra's base, which is a giant-sized Ant-Man suit with his dead skeleton still being inside it. Deadpool's joke about Paul Rudd never aging was spot-on. Seeing Ant-Man like that made me wonder what happened here.

Cassandra killing Johnny by skinning him after Deadpool gets him in trouble by falsely telling Cassandra that Johnny talked trash about her. Despite Johnny's denial, it seems like Deadpool was just blabbering, making the scene shocking. Deadpool's quip about the budget being too high to keep Johnny alive was funny. The post-credits scene where Johnny actually talks trash about Cassandra and then says ""Quote me"" was the icing on the cake. Additionally, the reference to Alioth from Loki (2021, 2023), with Deadpool citing the exact season and episode number, was a clever nod that added to the humor.

Nicepool was a clever addition along with all the different Deadpool variants like Ladypool, Kidpool, Cowboypool, and Dogpool. Each variant brought its own unique flair, adding to the film's overall comedic appeal.

Seeing X-23 (Dafne Keen), Blade (Wesley Snipes), Elektra (Jennifer Garner), and Gambit (Channing Tatum) was incredibly funny. Channing Tatum's accent and voice for this role were absolutely hilarious, and Deadpool's constant confusion about what he was saying was even funnier.

Every cameo, including Wunmi Mosaku and Chris Hemsworth, was perfectly executed. The movie does huge fan service, but at the same time, these characters contributed meaningfully to the plot, unlike in Spider-Man: No Way Home, where the inclusion of iconic characters felt forced and poorly handled. While I still like those characters, I can't believe how they managed to mess it up so badly. This is how you do it.

Everything was perfect, from Wolverine's yellow costume and helmet to the cocaine jokes. This film marks a perfect end to a trilogy and a strong start to the new multiverse era that Marvel is set to explore.

The character of Deadpool remains consistent: a loudmouth, dirty joke-telling anti-hero. It's commendable that Disney was adventurous, as there's no way you can buy the rights to Deadpool, bring back Wolverine, and expect Deadpool to be kid-friendly.",10.0,6,5,joy,POSITIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'story', 'sentiment': 'Positive'}]",POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8042371273040771}",Positive

Things take a turn as members from TVT (Time Variants) need Wade to travel in time and create a group for the MCU. Of course Wade decides to bring Logan Wolverine(Jackman) back again but in a different time frame to Logan 2017(where he died in that time frame).

Will he be able to save the rest of the crew. Expect alot of gory,violence and a couple of surprising cameos from previous MCU films.

I was worried they would fail to produce the character moments and leave them dry without any contribution to the film but they did not!

I giggled, was surprised, almost cried, and had fun watching the film throughout. I didn't feel any cringe or loss of interest in all the characters they pulled from different movies, and it made my dopamine rise. The story is well cooked.

Half of the critics don't understand fun, humor, breaking the fourth wall, Deadpool, the fims from 20th Century Fox, or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It seems they're too set in their ways to appreciate these elements and enjoy the film.",10.0,4,6,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.9324685335159302}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,Cinematic masterpiece,"To be honest it's been a while since I saw a good Marvel movie. Or just a movie that gave real movie vibes. But Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds made such a great thing that I can't even describe in words.

The music, special effects, the cameos and such a great and talented cast and team that worked on this movie. It's really amazing.

In the latest films I think the plot is too soon and everything happens so quickly. But in this movie everything was just in such a perfect time.

It was very detailed, which I think is very important in Marvel movies. THIS is what I've missed for such a long time.

This movie had no problems at all it gave us comic accurate suits of certain characters we know and love along with bringing in Gambit aka the guy fox movies never used barely at all.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Wolverine Until 90,"Hugh Jackman is Wolverine-there's just no doubt about it. This movie is such a wild ride! The witty dialogue, perfectly timed F-bombs, and the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously make it so entertaining. Plus, the surprise cameos? Totally caught me off guard (and I'm glad I didn't watch any spoiler videos beforehand for once).

There were some serious ""Oh, snap!"" moments that had me on the edge of my seat. The film is packed with action, laughs, and some meta moments with the hilarious Fox jokes and fourth-wall breaks-it's honestly too funny. I can already see plenty more sequels coming for this dynamic duo. I just watched these two doing the Hot Ones chicken wing challenge, and they were still killing it together.

Deadpool & Wolverine,The Ultimate 4th Wall Smash,"Pros:
-The Opening Scene/Credits

-Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine!!!

-Ryan Reynolds is still perfect as Deadpool.

-This may be the most Meta Movie Ever!

-Fantastic music choices throughout.

-Deadpool vs. Wolverine Rounds 1 & 2
-Flame On!

-Seeing Wesley Snipes return as Blade!

-The Campfire scene is a nice epilogue to Logan.

-The Deadpool Army

Cons:
-The story is paper-thin. It exists to get the characters from point A to B.

-Undermined the Wade/Vanessa relationship from the first two films.

-The villains are D-Tier level.

Well that was fun!!! Never in my life did I think we'd see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine after ""Logan"", let alone in film that tackles studio corporate politics and trolls the producers of the film, in the ultimate 4th wall smashing, blood-soaked action movie that is ""Deadpool & Wolverine"". Ryan Reynolds and the creative team take shots at everyone and everything in this film. At times it like a funeral for the prior MCU Marvel films and 20th Century Fox, while also lambasting the current state of the MCU. Hugh Jackman turns in a fantastic performance as 'the worst Wolverine'. After 24 years, no one understands the character better than he does. The action is bloody and fun! The cameos are surprising and remind the audience of all the marvel films that existed before the MCU. The moment between Logan and X-23 might be my favorite. The story exists solely to get Wolverine and Deadpool together. It's paper-thin but Ryan and Hugh know exactly why the audience is there. This is the buddy team-up movie that Ryan has wanted to make since ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". This film is a laugh a minute, especially for those of us who grew up on all the Marvel movies since the 90's.

Just see it for yourself and then you make the decision. It has a narrative. It has substance. It has the bloody action and violence and vulgar laughs that we expect for a Deadpool movie to have.

Deadpool & Wolverine,LFG,"First Impressions. I literally haven't had time to think any of my thoughts through. I've been so unbelievably hyped for this film and I'm so overwhelmed that it is here and that I've seen it.

To Deadpool Fans - this was indeed a Deadpool movie. The violence, epic fight scenes, the comedy, the vibes, Ryan Reynolds - everything that made the first two Deadpool movies great was all here.

To X-Men Fans - Hugh Jackman truly is THE X Man and proved it in this film. 24 years and he's still got it. Honestly, any time I was emotional it was because of him. What a real treat it was to see him on such a legendary scale.

To MCU Fans - This fits within the grand scheme of things but it really stands on it's own. The MCU is everywhere in terms of references and having background knowledge, at least from Loki, is helpful but not necessary. The movie stood on it's own without it and that's honestly a good thing.

We gotta talk cameos. Obviously the inclusion of Blade and Laura was outstanding. Happy's scene was a delight. But wow.... applause for Chris Evans. He Quick Silvered us with his Torch cameo and that was a huge highlight of the film for me.

I also want to shout out Matthew MacFadyen who has been an obsession of mine literally for several months now. I was sold on Deadpool and Wolverine years ago but Matthew being in that first trailer shook me. His character of Paradox was basically a more unhinged British Tom Wambsgans and it was a pleasure seeing him be a small part of such a phenomenal movie.

Again, Deadpool brings the best and most gruesome fights. Top 3 for me easily had to be the Intro Credits fight, Deadpool vs Wolverine in the car, and the Battle of the Deadpool Variants. Those variants.... that was so much fun. Shoutout to Welshpool. My great grandfather was born in Greece and raised in Wales and we still have family there so I took this variant personally lol.

It's ironic how this film was Deadpool's welcome to the MCU, but it also felt like a perfect ending. Logan was already a good ending, but this movie gave the character a happy ending. It left things open in case any character wanted to return, but it was also a solid ending altogether.

This is the end of my Marvel experience. Since Endgame I've ben trying to find an ending to my future Marvel marathons. My finale is Deadpool & Wolverine. I've loved many projects that has released in the last 5 years, but I've lost so much interest. I was really hanging on to the threads of Loki, Scarlet Witch, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Deadpool & Wolverine was the final line for me and I couldn't be happier. I'm satisfied with how this movie turned out. It was such a joy to experience a movie that has literally been 24 years in the making.

Thank you Ryan for fighting so hard to bring Deadpool to life. You created 3 masterful films. This is your legacy.

Thank you Hugh Jackman. You've been this character literally my entire life. Fans do not have enough words to describe how much you mean to us. We love you 3000.",10.0,2,4,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.946325421333313}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,Probably the best superhero movie in recent years,"If you look at the series of superhero movies released in the recent years, and even include the ones that are on the list for releasing for the rest of the year or even in 2025, this one is probably the most funny one. No doubt it's getting lots of rewards and hitting records on box office.

The story is smooth, the transitions are natural, fun and well paced.

Especially given the current age of short videos that people are very used to fast paced content, and people's attention span gets shorter every day, Ryan still produces high quality entertaining content.

But what I didn't like in Deadpool and Wolverine is the screenplay, extremely complex and messy plot, and pacing because the plot seriously makes the person who is watching lost and in some scenes, does not know what exactly happened and why it happened.

But these flaws do not mean that I didn't enjoy Deadpool and Wolverine. I enjoyed it, and I am looking forward to see what the MCU will carry for Deadpool, Wolverine, and the X-Men in the future.

Deadpool & Wolverine,A Comedy of Claws,"If you've ever wondered what happens when an Australian with a penchant for pointy things teams up with a Canadian guy who's essentially a walking one-liner factory, then look no further than ""Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comedy of Claws."" It's like if you took a buddy cop movie, added a sprinkle of mutant mayhem, and marinated it in a vat of chimichangas.

Plot Summary (Spoiler Alert: There Isn't One)

The plot is as thin as Deadpool's spandex after a long day of dodging responsibilities. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan (Hugh Jackman) embark on a nonsensical adventure that includes time travel, an overabundance of fourth-wall breaking, and a surprising number of references to both Hugh Jackman's musical career and Ryan Reynolds' love for gin (seriously, it's like a product placement for Aviation American Gin that's more in-your-face than Deadpool's costume).

Character Chemistry: A Match Made in Marvel

Deadpool and Wolverine's chemistry is electric-think a live wire crossed with a fur coat. Reynolds and Jackman play off each other like two toddlers fighting over the last cookie. Deadpool's incessant chatter contrasts beautifully with Wolverine's gruff demeanor. At one point, Deadpool tries to convince Wolverine to join him in a dance-off, which leads to the most hilarious and cringe-worthy choreography since that one awkward school prom.

The Humor: A Mixed Bag of Giggles and Groans

The humor is classic Deadpool-self-referential, absurd, and just the right amount of inappropriate. If you've ever wanted to hear Wolverine comment on the merits of avocado toast while simultaneously dismembering a villain, this is your film. The jokes come fast and furious, so keep your eyes peeled; if you blink, you might miss a hilarious jab at the DCEU or a cheeky meta-commentary on the film's own budget.

Action Sequences: Claws and Comedy

The action scenes are as over-the-top as you'd expect. Picture Wolverine slicing through bad guys while Deadpool distracts them with interpretive dance (yes, it happens). The choreography is impressive, with enough explosions to make Michael Bay shed a tear of joy. And let's not forget the CGI! If you're a fan of seeing Wolverine's healing factor in action, you'll be thrilled, especially when Deadpool tries to ""help"" him heal with a bottle of tequila.

Cameos and Surprises

Without giving too much away, keep an eye out for some unexpected cameos that will make any comic book nerd squeal with delight. Just when you think the film can't get any crazier, it does-much like Deadpool's love life.

Final Thoughts: A Must-See for Marvel Fans

""Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comedy of Claws"" is a delightful romp through the absurdity of the superhero genre. It's a film that doesn't take itself seriously, and thankfully, neither should you. So grab your friends, some popcorn, and prepare for a wild ride that's equal parts action, comedy, and utter chaos. Just don't forget to stick around for the post-credits scenes because, like Logan's hair, they're legendary.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a film that combines the best of both worlds-sardonic humor and a penchant for violence-this is the cinematic equivalent of a chimichanga filled with pure joy. Just be prepared for the laughter (and possibly the eye-rolls) to come in equal measure!",10.0,1,7,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8260652422904968}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,What a waste!,"As a long-time Marvel fan, I went into ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" with high hopes, but left the theater feeling more than a bit let down. While the film promised an epic crossover between two iconic characters, it somehow failed to capture the essence of what makes both Deadpool and Wolverine so beloved.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool, who usually brings a sharp wit and irreverent humor, felt overused and surprisingly flat. The jokes fell short, and the meta-commentary, which has always been a staple of Deadpool's charm, seemed forced. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, a character known for his grit and depth, was reduced to playing the straight man to Deadpool's antics, which did a disservice to the complexity we've come to expect from Logan.

The plot, which revolved around a convoluted time-travel narrative, felt disjointed and lacked coherence. It seemed more interested in setting up future spin-offs than telling a compelling story. The action sequences, although visually stunning, felt hollow without the emotional weight that usually anchors Marvel films.

In the end, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" came across as a missed opportunity-a clash of two larger-than-life characters that never quite found its footing.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Needs to borrow all of Hugh Jackman's credibility and charm,"I liked the first two 'Deadpool' pictures quite a bit. They were fun and irreverent and they had a healthy self-deprecating view on comic book movies. I love Hugh Jackman as Logan. His performance and evolution with the role stands out as a major achievement in pulp entertainment. 'Deadpool and Wolverine' is a disappointment as a sequel and as a piece of world building. It is an MCU mess that exacerbates all the problems that have plagued the post-'Endgame' output. Deadpool is meta enough to remind us that the MCU is at a bit of a low point but that isn't the subtext. 'Deadpool and Wolverine' is an exercise in self-masturbation to the MCU and thus you took away the bite from the character.

Reynolds is fine in the title role. He doesn't do anything new or subversive here. The main comparison I would make to the other 'Deadpool' films is Deadpool stood out because he loudly clashed with cliches. This Deadpool embraces cliche villains and tropes about heroism and family that just feel stupid and thematically wrong for 'Deadpool'. He is giving us toothless MCUisms.

And he isn't really allowed to participate in the MCU at large. No major character makes a cameo and the story doesn't seem to have stakes that will play out in future entries so it's another case of marketing pointless Easter eggs. You could fit Owen Wilson from 'Loki,' and he'd be right at home

The film does contain the much talked about cameos. They're fine and I can see why people were glad to see these characters again. They are portrayed as hip and cool when all of these characters (save one) had unceremonious endings in mediocre movies. This movie treats them with a reverence worthy of 'Endgame'. People didn't love 'Elektra'. Channing Tatum sounds like a moron with his Cajun accent. They are screaming for a harsher roast than Deadpool provides.

Hugh Jackman is why this movie works in parts. He takes the material seriously and plays the utmost straight man to Reynolds. The movie also is very reverential to 'Logan' in the right way. This Wolverine variant works as his own tragic character and there are genuine moments of emotion from Jackman amidst the chaos. I'm glad he came back just because I enjoy him in this role.

This is a lesser 'Deadpool' movie but when it works I think fans will enjoy it.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Disappointing Showdown,"This movie was an eagerly anticipated showdown that promised an exhilarating clash between two of Marvel's most beloved anti-heroes. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to the hype, leaving fans with more frustration than satisfaction.

First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. Rather than delivering a coherent narrative, the film is a jumble of disconnected scenes and over-the-top antics that lack any real substance. The story feels like an afterthought, merely an excuse to bring these two characters together without any meaningful development or stakes.

Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, while charismatic as always, seem to struggle with the material they are given. Their performances come off as forced, as if they themselves are not convinced by the direction of the film. The banter between Deadpool and Wolverine, which should have been a highlight, often falls flat and feels repetitive.

The action sequences, typically a saving grace in such films, are surprisingly underwhelming. Despite the potential for epic battles, the choreography is lackluster and the special effects feel subpar compared to other recent Marvel entries. Instead of jaw-dropping fights, we get a series of poorly executed set pieces that fail to impress.

Moreover, the film tries too hard to blend Deadpool's irreverent humor with Wolverine's brooding nature, resulting in an awkward tonal imbalance. The humor feels forced and out of place, while the darker, more serious moments lack the emotional depth needed to resonate with the audience.

In conclusion, this movie is a missed opportunity. It squanders the potential of its iconic characters with a disjointed plot, mediocre action, and a tone that fails to strike the right balance. Fans of both Deadpool and Wolverine will likely walk away disappointed, wishing for a more worthy confrontation between these two legendary figures.",1.0,27,36,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.8489989638328552}",Negative

Deadpool & Wolverine,Disappointment,"The movie was disappointing and of low quality. It's difficult for me to understand how the demands of the younger generation have shifted so drastically. The film lacked a coherent story, meaningful message, or purpose. It seems to cater to a generation raised on unrealistic expectations, driven by video games, superpowers, and violence.

I'm not suggesting that the past was inherently better-every era has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, it's concerning to see how this generation seems disconnected from reality, growing up with diminished values, less education, and a greater tolerance for violence. Perhaps we, as a society, are partly to blame for this shift.

I can't help but worry about the future. Will the next generation be even more immersed in violence and fantasy, abandoning education altogether? In a world where books have been replaced by movies, it's crucial that films guide the younger generation toward a better future, rather than simply offering mindless entertainment filled with violence.",1.0,12,15,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'movie', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'film', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.9021415114402771}",Negative
Deadpool & Wolverine,Deadpool & Wolverine Honest Opinion,"Alright, so I just watched *Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)*, and I have to say, it was a pretty fun ride, though not without its flaws. As a fan of both characters, I was excited to see how they would mesh together on the big screen, and for the most part, it delivered.

First off, the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) is fantastic. Their banter and comedic timing are spot on, and you can tell they're having a blast playing off each other. The humor is exactly what you'd expect from a Deadpool movie-irreverent, meta, and sometimes downright silly. There were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that had the whole theater cracking up.

The action scenes are another highlight. They're well-choreographed and packed with the kind of over-the-top violence that fans of both characters will appreciate. Seeing Deadpool and Wolverine team up to take down bad guys is as satisfying as it sounds, and the movie doesn't hold back on the gore.

However, the plot is where things start to wobble a bit. It's a bit all over the place, and at times, it feels like the movie is trying to juggle too many subplots. Some of the storylines don't get the attention they deserve, and a few characters feel underdeveloped. I found myself wishing for a bit more depth and coherence in the narrative.

Another thing that didn't quite hit the mark for me was the pacing. The movie starts off strong but loses momentum in the middle. There are a few scenes that drag on longer than necessary, and it feels like the film could have been tighter overall.

Despite these issues, *Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)* is still an enjoyable watch. It's not perfect, but if you're a fan of the characters, you'll likely have a good time. The humor, action, and chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman make it worth checking out, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of their solo outings.

So, in summary, I liked it but didn't love it. It's a fun movie with some great moments, but it could have been better with a more focused plot and tighter pacing. If you're a fan of Deadpool and Wolverine, it's definitely worth a watch, just maybe temper your expectations a bit.",5.0,3,2,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.8488329648971558}",Positive
Deadpool & Wolverine,Was Hoping for Better,"The opening is pretty funny. I really liked the use of music in the battle scenes. Who ever was there music person did a great job. I thought most of the jokes were pretty funny.

I would have to say the worst part of the movie is Channing Tatum and I like him as an actor but whoever came up with his character should have done a better job. His outfit is stupid. His hair is stupid and his super powers are explosive cards/magic tricks. Also how he talks is stupid. I get it they were trying to make it hard to understand him but it was awful to watch.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Cheap action and cheap humour,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" attempts to blend the irreverent charm of Deadpool with the brooding intensity of Wolverine, but ultimately falls flat with its reliance on cheap action and humor. While the idea of pairing these iconic characters promises an exciting ride, the execution leaves much to be desired.

One of the most glaring issues is the film's CGI. Despite the high stakes and explosive action scenes, the special effects feel disappointingly low-budget. From poorly rendered explosions to unconvincing character animations, the visual spectacle is marred by a sense of cheapness that detracts from the immersion. The scenes that should have been awe-inspiring instead come off as lackluster, failing to live up to the standards set by previous superhero films.

The gore, a staple in both characters' narratives, is equally uninspired and tasteless. Rather than adding to the intensity or emotional weight of the story, it feels gratuitous and poorly executed.

The humor, which is supposed to be one of Deadpool's strong suits, falls into a similar trap. The film is saturated with cheap jokes, with about 90% relying on sexual innuendos and crass humor. While Deadpool is known for his irreverence, the over-reliance on this type of comedy quickly grows tiresome. Instead of clever wit or genuinely funny moments, viewers are bombarded with lowbrow humor that fails to elicit more than a few chuckles.

In summary, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a disappointing entry in the superhero genre. With its cheap CGI, uninspired gore, and overwhelmingly sexual humor, the film struggles to find a balance between action and comedy, leaving fans longing for the days when these characters were handled with more care and creativity.",4.0,2,3,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.9246411323547363}",Negative
Deadpool & Wolverine,Very disappointed screenplay and storyline.,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" had the potential to be a blockbuster, bringing together two of the most beloved and iconic characters from the Marvel Universe. However, the film feels like a missed opportunity, coming across as disconnected and poorly written. While there are moments that may appeal to hardcore fans, the movie, on the whole, struggles to find its footing, leaving casual viewers feeling unsatisfied.

Wolverine, on the other hand, is portrayed in a way that feels disconnected from the character's previous iterations. The brooding, conflicted hero is replaced by a version of Wolverine that feels more like a supporting character than a co-lead. The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine, which could have been a highlight of the film, lacks the chemistry and depth needed to make their interactions meaningful. Instead, their relationship feels superficial, with the film relying on cheap thrills and action sequences rather than meaningful character development.

Dialogue and Humor

One of the most disappointing aspects of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is the dialogue. The film is riddled with cheap, one-liner jokes that lack the cleverness and wit that fans have come to expect from Deadpool. The humor often feels forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to replicate the success of the previous Deadpool films without truly understanding what made those films work.

Wolverine's dialogue, too, suffers from a lack of substance. His character is known for his terse, no-nonsense approach, but in this film, his lines are often reduced to generic tough-guy clich√©s. The dialogue fails to capture the essence of who these characters are, making their interactions feel hollow and unengaging.

Direction and Pacing

The direction of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" contributes to the overall sense of disconnection in the film. The pacing is uneven, with scenes that drag on too long interspersed with abrupt action sequences that feel out of place. The film struggles to find a rhythm, leaving viewers unsure of what tone it is trying to achieve. Is it a dark, gritty superhero drama or a lighthearted, comedic romp? The film never seems to make up its mind, resulting in a jarring viewing experience.

Catering to Hardcore Fans

While ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" may not work for the average moviegoer, it does have moments that will likely appeal to hardcore fans. The film is peppered with Easter eggs, references, and callbacks to the comics that only the most dedicated fans will appreciate. However, even these moments feel like a crutch, as if the film is leaning on fan service to compensate for its lack of substance. For those who are deeply invested in the Marvel Universe, these nods to the source material may provide some enjoyment, but for others, they do little to enhance the overall experience.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film that falls short of its potential. The disjointed plot, lackluster character development, and cheap dialogue make it a disappointing addition to the Marvel franchise. While hardcore fans may find some enjoyment in the film's references and Easter eggs, casual viewers are likely to walk away feeling underwhelmed. This movie is a testament to the fact that even with beloved characters, a film needs a strong story, well-crafted dialogue, and thoughtful direction to truly succeed.",5.0,2,3,sadness,NEGATIVE,0,"[{'aspect': 'dialogue', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'scene', 'sentiment': 'Negative'}]",NEGATIVE,negative,negative,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Negative', 'confidence': 0.9044434428215027}",Negative

Deadpool & Wolverine,"A whimsical, vain, and pointless cameo-infested Cowboy film","Legitimate question here, did artificial intelligence actually write this movie? Its a legitimate question because the shallowness, idiocy and perplexingly nonsensical jokes could not possibly have been written by people who just got done with a rather lengthy strike in Hollywood. In fact they sound like jokes from a script that someone has been sitting on for quite a while considering the gap between Deadpool 2, and this third installment. No offense, but if this is modern comedy in an action fantasy film, please place it back in the oven or grab as its not done yet. Only the most dedicated mouth breathing casual audience could possibly find anything entertaining in a film where half the jokes are bad computer animated fight sequences with lame 80's (and unfortunately newer) pop songs playing in the background. How groundbreaking, since apparently if you did this in a little movie called ""Suicide Squad"" (both if we're honest) people think its kind of garbage. Not unlike Paul Rudd's career, Ryan Reynolds has seen his heyday pass him by as well, since his claim to fame is ""those deadpool movies and insurance commercials,"" what a legacy Ryan. Yet, here he is the one cracking a joke at Paul Rudd's equally dead franchise i.e. Antman. How brave. Worse than the overwritten dialogue is probably the odd dichotomy of having to both pretend Wade's deadpool actually cares about anything between all the offensively unintelligent jokes at I suppose whatever the AI algorithm came up- like this gem:

""You know what? You're a ******* joke. No wonder the Avengers didn't take you or the X-Men, and they'll take ******* anyone. I mean, you are a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron. I have never met a sadder, more attention-starved jabbering little ***** in my entire life, and that says a lot because I've been alive for more than two hundred ******* years! And I'll tell you, that bald chick was right about one thing: you will never save the world. You couldn't even save a relationship with a ******* stripper! Mother******, I wish I could say you'll die alone, but it's one of God's best jokes that you can't die! Except that's on all of us! You got nothing to say, mouth?""

This enormously out-of-touch speech is the most overwritten, pretentious, fourth wall breaking trash I've ever heard or read in my life. These characters have so little actual growth, that they have to invent some lame speech for Logan to present to Deadpool, even when he has little reason to know any details of Wade's life, or his accomplishments prior to this film (almost like they forgot to mention those two other movies or something). Here-in lies the problem with a movie where two of the main characters have to be blank slates in order for the script-writers to do anything. Cameos galore cannot save a movie where the two main characters learn nothing about each other, babble insane lines that don't even rationalize their own behavior since we are only aware of them from previous franchises, which the writers are relying on so they don't have to do any actual heavy-lifting. All the 70 year old Wesley Snipers in the world can't save your dumb buddy cop film with cheesy one-liners, cartoon violence computer animation, and disgusting tonal dissonance whenever some lame song that plays at Walmart all day comes on as if it means anything at all.

You can say I ""don't like fun,"" but I've seen these movies, they've been coming out for years and they have no other direction to take except for maybe self-parody. There were so many lame jokes about Disney and Fox that only some corporate suit knowledgeable about rights issues, licenses, marketing and IP's could have suggested them to the AI. Cowboy films also became their own walking parody, so much so that an Italian director ended up making some of the best Cowboy films ever made (and the cheesiest too). The fact that people are still slow to understand the idea of ""Sphaghetti super hero film"" as long as it has someone recognizable in it, tells you a lot about our current generation of movie-goers and their expectations. The bar is pretty low, but luckily the collective memory of goldfish isn't dictated by how many of them are in one fish-tank. Over 20 years ago, X-men was popular because it was doing something different, that was when comic book sales weren't completely on life-support like they are now. Yes, its sad, but they had it coming, and like-wise so do movies starring 70 year old ""Blades"" spouting the same terrible lines he made infamous so long ago that I forgot they were even remaking Blade. If you do not take time to humanize these characters, develop good stories for them (like Logan) and rely on parody, you will end up stepping into the same quicksand Marvel slipped into.

The End,"I tried so hard...not to sleep...In ""The End"" it doesn't even matter.","The End, directed by Joshua Oppenheimer is a musical. It did not even take an hour into this ""loooong"" two and half hour plus movie for most of the viewers to totally resonate with the movie and dance their way out of the hall.

If there is a Nobel prize for patience, a few bunch of us who sit through the whole movie deserve it for sure.

The idea was great..And it's okay that all ideas may not come up successful on execution. The End fell short according to my P. O. V that even though it looked great on papers when it was made into a movie, it did not connect with me.

Maybe it's also my incompetence to analyse a musical of this style.

Going with a new trend of ""Genre Mixing"": The End, is a cocktail of post apocalyptic set up blended with a musical style narrative structure. Put a slice of self exploration of human character on top of it: Voila, your movie is ready.

It appeared like the filmmaker got a great idea during the pandemic time:- Did we really hold tight to the people whom we love during the pandemic? Did we do anything to save them? Or did we just run away to our comfort and safe zone and close the door to all of our beloved friends and family treating exactly how we treated the virus?

After writing the screenplay the filmmaker thought about how to make it different. And decided to make the characters sing the dialogues of every fifth scene as song instead of saying it. According to me, whatever little emotional attachment which was growing towards the characters were nullified by this act.

The story is simple: A very rich family consisting of a Son and his family is living a comfortable life inside a salt mine in a post apocalyptic world. They are supposed to be the only family alive in the earth. They sing, dance, write books, decorate the home with paintings, plastic flowers and other antique items. The family is accompanied by a chef, a doctor and a manager(I guess). It's shown as if they have accumulated ample resources for generations to live. In short they are living a very organised yet safe life.

It's into their world when a woman arrives. First the initial hesitation, she is accepted by the family.

Her arrival creates lots of uninvited conflicts, unasked questions within the family. The film explores the themes of guilt, grief, shift of power centers etc.

The father who was into energy business proudly believed that he was actually saving the world from poverty and developing the society. But now after the apocalypse, he doubts if he is actually saving the world or destroying the world. The son is exploring his first encounter with a woman in his life while also being struck between lots of questions that have risen. The mother repent of the possibility of saving a few more people at least for her family. This created lots of internal tension within the family.

Will they find solace in the end?

Will the music heal their past and will they accept their faults and reunite.

The performance was good. By coincidence, Watched back to back movies of Tilda Swinton: The End and The Room Next Door.

Post apocalyptic satirical musical.

It's 2.5 hours long, so I wasn't thinking before. You think about when he's here.

George McKee as the lead. He plays the son, Michael Shannon plays the father, and Tilda Swinton plays the mother. And they all sing in this movie. Let's see this with the blurb on the on their box. As 25 years after an environmental collapse of Earth left their some uninhabitable, mother, father and son are confined to the palatial bunker where they struggle to maintain hope and a sense of normality by clinging to the rituals of daily life until the arrival.

upends their routine and tensions rise. Their seemingly idyllic existence starts to crumble. So the first thing you'll see with this, let's talk about the good. So all the actors involved are good. None of them are in, you know, are in bad movies.

Tim McInerney put on a Gallagher, Daniel Rain, Lady James.

They all kind of round out the supporting cast. But the main, the main three leads would be, Tell us, with George McKee and Michael Shannon, and they're all doing interesting accents. Well, apart from Michael Shannon, I think he's just he's just doing name issues to neon accents. The cinematography in the set design as like exquisite. It looks really, really good.

Different rooms and the different colors, the kind of muted color palette can accordance. Aiden with characters, mental states and things like that is really clever. The way they do that, the camerawork as it goes from room to room and the bunker and the colors change and whatnot. It's almost like game. It's almost like the entire set, as that's one of the is one of those mid-range that you used to get that would change, you know, with your mood.

So that element of it worked really well.

What didn't work really well was the length and the fact that it feels like it felt like two movies and one that's a musical, but there's not that much singing in it. Those, those big, big stretches in between, you know, song and dance numbers to the point where it feels like every time they start singing and dancing, it feels like they'll just bring in the pace of the movie to a halt.

Like, I'd love to see an edit of this without the music and conversely, I'd love to see an edit of this where it's, you know, it's more or less just the music because it feels like if it was like two different movies combined, any one the nonmusical element, which is like a fairly am fairly serious drama, and then the musical element, which is fairly fantastical, those two elements, for me, they just, they just didn't gel that well.

I kind of like ten Cloverfield Lane meets the Joker would be my M my movie mash up description of of Joshua Oppenheimer at the end. Again, I think this will be a bit of a polarizing movie. Sarah from the Popcorn Movie Chat. I think that's all I know on Instagram. I know she she was at the Glasgow Film Festival and she actually did enjoy this movie.

For him, justice is non-negotiable, and his actions are guided by a strict moral code. He patrols a decaying society not for fame or power but because he believes it is the right thing to do.

The murder of Edward Blake (The Comedian) sets Rorschach on a path of relentless investigation. Where others see a random crime, he uncovers a conspiracy that threatens millions. His determination to expose the truth, no matter the obstacles or dangers, highlights his greatest quality: an unshakable belief in honesty and justice. Unlike his colleagues, who grow weary or disillusioned, Rorschach never wavers.

In the climax, his moral integrity is tested. Ozymandias reveals his plan to sacrifice millions to unite the world and avert nuclear war. While others, including Dr. Manhattan, accept this as a necessary evil, Rorschach refuses. For him, the ends do not justify the means. He boldly declares, ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon."" This line captures his essence: a man who would rather die than betray his principles.

Rorschach's refusal to stay silent about Ozymandias' crimes ultimately leads to his death. Confronted by Dr. Manhattan, he demands to be killed rather than live knowing the truth will be buried. His death is not a defeat but a final act of defiance, a statement that justice and truth are worth more than life itself.

Though brutal and uncompromising, Rorschach stands as the moral heart of Watchmen. In a world of moral ambiguity, he is a rare figure who holds firm to his ideals. His tragic end serves as a reminder of the cost of integrity in a corrupt world. Rorschach's legacy is not just his actions but his unwavering belief that truth and justice are worth any sacrifice.",9.0,18,13,anger,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,negative,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7473353147506714}",EMPTY
Watchmen: Chapter II,Brings more information than the second half of the live action movie,"I was wondering what was the purpose of this animation, since Chapter I basically followed the same narrative as the film from 2009. Well, Chapter II does add more stuff in, explaining some things left vague in the film, making the parallels with The Black Freighter subplot more evident and even having a slightly different ending which made a lot more sense to me.

I liked the animation, I found the voice acting good, and I rated this this high because when it came out I was blown away by the 2009 movie. I have to hope that without having seen it, I would have been just as enthusiastic about this animation. As it stands, it brings extra value, but not enough to justify its existence. I've heard a lot of people talking about how the comics are so much deeper and better. Why, then, were these two cinematic versions so similar?

Bottom line: Watchmen is a very deep and interesting story about personal and societal responsibility and moral sense. I think it's great! Whether you chose this or the 2009 movie, I recommend them highly. I just don't see the point of watching both versions, since they are very similar. If you don't have anything against animation, I think I recommend this version to the live one.",9.0,3,6,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7990059852600098}",EMPTY
Daniela Forever,be careful what you wish for,"After the sudden death of his lover Daniela, Nick experiments with a new drug that provides the user with the ability to control their own dreams. Nick not only dreams about Daniela, but strives to reshape the memories of her. This fantasy world that he inhabits clashes with reality, relatives, friends, and Nick's own psyche.

I love the premise of Daniela Forever. It is interesting to think about and explore what we might do if given sway over dreams. Wondering if we could let go of control, deal with changes, and let others be as they are. I wish there was more depth to the dialogue and the scenes. While the setting for the film is Madrid, English is spoken much of the time. The director and main actors were present for this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. ""I'm going to cry a bit,"" said Nacho ""the film is coming from a dark place."" The film's soundtrack features the ""coolest band in Spain.""",8.0,2,0,joy,POSITIVE,0,[],POSITIVE,positive,positive,1,NEGATIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.529293954372406}",EMPTY
Levels,Proper Sci-Fi,"This is an excellent science fiction story, with competent production values, and a great performance by Cara Gee (The Expanse). If you appreciate science (the first part of Sci-Fi), then this movie is for you. The story and EXCELLENT conclusion, present cogent scientific principles which are far more compelling than the movie it initially appears to analogize.

It is unfortunate in this day and age that the consumer market demands the simplicity of a comic-book videogame superhero plot, which has little relation to actual science, but remains misnomered as ""Science Fiction"" -- hence rebranding of the SyFy channel to preclude actual science, for monsters and sharknados. And yes, halfway through Alien: Romulus, I found the story about as interesting as a Scooby-Doo cartoon, and stopped watching. Sorry to those of you who imagine that monsters, demi-gods, and over-the-top violence are ""science.""

The fact that this movie has multiple ""LEVELS"" (thus the title) and a sophisticated ending does not make it mediocre. Rather, it is viewer dissatisfaction with a primarily cerebral story which apparently garners fewer stars.",9.0,21,27,joy,NEGATIVE,0,[],NEGATIVE,positive,positive,1,POSITIVE,"{'label': 'Positive', 'confidence': 0.7058631181716919}",EMPTY
Levels,[5.8] Not enough,"A nice Canadian sci-fi, mini thriller with average actions, lots of love, a nice futuristic premise with a tight budget that couldn't compete with Hollywood blockbusters like some futuristic movies of the past like the big Matr. And a movie that Tom Cruise acted on around 10 years ago.

It is nice to follow the journey, could have been more futuristic in shape-shifting mode like Lucy and mutationward like The Species and X-M.

Nice effort for the budget and above-average.
